README for DOSBox-X
===================

Welcome to DOSBox-X, a cross-platform DOS emulator based on the DOSBox project.

Like DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.

As a general-purpose DOS emulator, DOSBox-X has many useful and unique features that do not exist in other emulators like DOSBox, such as GUI menu and configuration tool, the ability to save and load state, support for more DOS commands and utilities, better compatibility with DOS applications, as well as Windows clipboard and long filename support for a tighter Windows integration. With DOSBox-X you can run most DOS applications and games reliably in a DOS virtual machine. For more information about DOSBox-X, please read the online user guide in the DOSBox-X Wiki.
