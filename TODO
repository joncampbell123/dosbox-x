DOSBox Integrated Graphics:
- Why does VBETEST's line drawing glitch out for mode 0x10D (320x200 15bpp). It makes the test for that mode
  either take way too long or never complete.
- HD (1920x1080) modes crash the emulator if the Video Debug Overlay is enabled.
- INT 10h modelist: Add a field to the modelist struct that allows the modelist to specify a display aspect ratio.
- VESAMOED: Add parameters that allow the user to edit the VESA BIOS modelist and control the display aspect ratio. You want to make a custom mode with a wacky aspect ratio like 21:9? Go for it. Make sure the program indicates in the param list the aspect ratio settings only apply to machine=svga_dosbox.
- doublescan setting should become "true" "false" or "auto". "auto" is like true, but automatically becomes false when the user selects any render scaler other than the scale2x, etc. scalers. If the user wants to use the mame upscalers the doublescan setting shouldn't get in the way.
- DOSBox IG should use vscale register for low res VESA BIOS modes to double the pixels as normal SVGA cards do.
- Video debug overlay reporting source -> display resolutions for CGA/MDA/HERC/etc. assumes that 2x/4x row height is interleaved graphics, but remember there's that 160x100 text mode "graphics" mode some games use.
[DONE]
- Video debug overlay fix info for DOSBox IG, the text is too long on one line and the EPAL palette can overlap it.
- Need to implement get/set scanline length, so VBETEST can do the full panning test
- Video debug overlay does not reflect Integrated Graphics width/height/bytesperscanline/hpel state when active,
  still shows VGA state underneath.
- video debug overlay, when DOSBox IG is enabled, does not show hpel [FIXED]
- Add register to control pixel aspect ratio, so that it can fix the distorted frame when "fit to aspect ratio" is set. 1920x1080 has a 16:9 aspect ratio, not a 4:3 aspect ratio.
- 16:9 VESA BIOS modes, when "fit to aspect ratio", are squeezed as if 4:3. [FIXED]

DOSBox scaler render system:
- Render scaler code crashes if the GFX display is larger than 1920x1080. Add code to bypass scalers entirely and draw directly to the SDL surface if the resolution is greater than 1920x1080. At that high resolution there is no need for scalers (you probably can't see the effects of the more elaborate ones anyway), and you probably have a GPU through which you can use the OpenGL output mode to scale up to your screen if for some reason you have an 8K monitor.
