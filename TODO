DOSBox Integrated Graphics:
- Video debug overlay does not reflect Integrated Graphics width/height/bytesperscanline/hpel state when active,
  still shows VGA state underneath.
- Why does VBETEST's line drawing glitch out for mode 0x10D (320x200 15bpp). It makes the test for that mode
  either take way too long or never complete.
[DONE]
- Need to implement get/set scanline length, so VBETEST can do the full panning test
