Render on Demand:
- XARGON: Causes extra long pause going from initial title screen to main menu.

Render on Demand + Wait for Changes:
- Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure (cosmo):

  Wait for Changes appears to affect Cosmo's rendering and page flipping. The normally regular (8fps?) frame
  rate becomes somewhat irregular.
[DONE]
- XARGON: Wait for Changes often fails to update display when Xargon shows a popup message on the screen.
          Xargon is using VGA unchained page flipping. The page flip to present the popup fails to render.
          Perhaps the RenderComplete VGA function is rendering the entire frame in response BEFORE the
          new start address takes effect. [FIXED]
- Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons (keen1):
  Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter (keen6):
  Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure (cosmo):

  Wait for Changes fails to update display when game uses only the attribute controller palette to "fade in"
  and "fade out" the display. These games target the EGA where that is a more practical palette-based way
  to do it. There is no VGA palette on EGA.

DOSBox Integrated Graphics:
- INT 10h modelist: Add a field to the modelist struct that allows the modelist to specify a display aspect ratio.
- VESAMOED: Add parameters that allow the user to edit the VESA BIOS modelist and control the display aspect ratio. You want to make a custom mode with a wacky aspect ratio like 21:9? Go for it. Make sure the program indicates in the param list the aspect ratio settings only apply to machine=svga_dosbox.
- doublescan setting should become "true" "false" or "auto". "auto" is like true, but automatically becomes false when the user selects any render scaler other than the scale2x, etc. scalers. If the user wants to use the mame upscalers the doublescan setting shouldn't get in the way.
- Video debug overlay reporting source -> display resolutions for CGA/MDA/HERC/etc. assumes that 2x/4x row height is interleaved graphics, but remember there's that 160x100 text mode "graphics" mode some games use.
- VESA BIOS emulation is correct in not listing modes that there is not enough video memory to set, but, if you know the video mode by number you can set it anyway. The mode set function should refuse to set such modes.
[DONE]
- HD (1920x1080) modes crash the emulator if the Video Debug Overlay is enabled. [FIXED: Now it just stops rendering]
- Why does VBETEST's line drawing glitch out for mode 0x10D (320x200 15bpp). It makes the test for that mode
  either take way too long or never complete. ANSWER: Mode 0x10D is INT 10 mode 0x75, and 0x75 is a JEGA mode, which is M_CGA4, which confuses the VESA BIOS code.
- DOSBox IG should use vscale register for low res VESA BIOS modes to double the pixels as normal SVGA cards do.
- Video debug overlay fix info for DOSBox IG, the text is too long on one line and the EPAL palette can overlap it.
- Need to implement get/set scanline length, so VBETEST can do the full panning test
- Video debug overlay does not reflect Integrated Graphics width/height/bytesperscanline/hpel state when active,
  still shows VGA state underneath.
- video debug overlay, when DOSBox IG is enabled, does not show hpel [FIXED]
- Add register to control pixel aspect ratio, so that it can fix the distorted frame when "fit to aspect ratio" is set. 1920x1080 has a 16:9 aspect ratio, not a 4:3 aspect ratio.
- 16:9 VESA BIOS modes, when "fit to aspect ratio", are squeezed as if 4:3. [FIXED]

DOSBox scaler render system:
- Render scaler code crashes if the GFX display is larger than 1920x1080. Add code to bypass scalers entirely and draw directly to the SDL surface if the resolution is greater than 1920x1080. At that high resolution there is no need for scalers (you probably can't see the effects of the more elaborate ones anyway), and you probably have a GPU through which you can use the OpenGL output mode to scale up to your screen if for some reason you have an 8K monitor.
