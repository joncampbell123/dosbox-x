#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                     Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                     If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.

#                                                    Possible values: default, avi-zmbv, mpegts-h264.
#                       mainline compatible mapping: If set, arrange private areas, UMBs, and DOS kernel structures by default in the same way the mainline branch would do it.
#                                                    If cleared, these areas are allocated dynamically which may improve available memory and emulation accuracy.
#                                                    If your DOS game breaks under DOSBox-X but works with mainline DOSBox setting this option may help.
#                  mainline compatible bios mapping: If set, arrange the BIOS area in the same way that the mainline branch would do it.
#                                                    If cleared, these areas are allocated dynamically which may improve available memory and emulation accuracy.

#                                adapter rom is ram: Map adapter ROM as RAM (mainline DOSBox 0.74 behavior). When clear, unused adapter ROM is mapped out
#                            shell environment size: Size of the initial DOSBox shell environment block, in bytes. This does not affect the environment block of sub-processes spawned from the shell.
#                                                    This option has no effect unless dynamic kernel allocation is enabled.
#                                 private area size: Set DOSBox-X private memory area size. This area contains private memory structures used by the DOS kernel.
#                                                    It is discarded when you boot into another OS. Mainline DOSBox uses 32KB. Testing shows that it is possible
#                                                    to run DOSBox with as little as 4KB. If DOSBox-X aborts with error "not enough memory for internal tables"

#                                                    on_fake/off_fake are intended to test whether a program carries out a memory test to ensure the A20

#                                                    This can be used to help diagnose whether or not the DOS game is page flipping properly according to vertical retrace if the display on-screen is flickering.
#                  vertical retrace poll debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse green dotted line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC status port (0x3DA) was read.
#                                                    This can be used to help diagnose whether the DOS game is propertly waiting for vertical retrace.

#                            vga 3da undefined bits: VGA status port 3BA/3DAh only defines bits 0 and 3. This setting allows you to assign a bit pattern to the undefined bits.
#                                                    The purpose of this hack is to deal with demos that read and handle port 3DAh in ways that might crash if all are zero.
#                                                    By default, this value is zero.
#                    unmask timer on int 10 setmode: If set, INT 10h will unmask IRQ 0 (timer) when setting video modes.
#                    unmask keyboard on int 16 read: If set, INT 16h will unmask IRQ 1 (keyboard) when asked to read keyboard input.
#   int16 keyboard polling undocumented cf behavior: If set, INT 16h function AH=01h will also set/clear the carry flag depending on whether input was available.
#                                                    There are some old DOS games and demos that rely on this behavior to sense keyboard input, and this behavior
#                                                    has been verified to occur on some old (early 90s) BIOSes.
#                               allow port 92 reset: If set (default), allow the application to reset the CPU through port 92h
#                                    enable port 92: Emulate port 92h (PS/2 system control port A). If you want to emulate a system that predates the PS/2, set to 0.
#                         enable 1st dma controller: Emulate 1st (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a system that lacks DMA (PCjr and some Tandy systems)
#                         enable 2nd dma controller: Emulate 2nd (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a PC/XT system without 16-bit DMA.
#                                                    Note: mainline DOSBox automatically disables 16-bit DMA when machine=cga or machine=hercules, while DOSBox-X does not.
#                       allow dma address decrement: If set, allow increment & decrement modes as specified in the 8237 datasheet.
#                                                    If clear, always increment the address (as if to emulate clone 8237 implementations that skipped the inc/dec bit).
#                    enable 128k capable 16-bit dma: If true, DMA controller emulation models ISA hardware that permits 16-bit DMA to span 128KB.
#                                                    If false, DMA controller emulation models PCI hardware that limits 16-bit DMA to 64KB boundaries.
#                                                    If auto, the choice is made according to other factors in hardware emulation
#                                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                   enable dma extra page registers: If set, emulate the extra page registers (I/O ports 0x80, 0x84-0x86, 0x88, 0x8C-0x8E), like actual hardware.
#                                                    Note that mainline DOSBox behavior is to NOT emulate these registers.
#                     dma page registers write-only: Normally (on AT hardware) the DMA page registers are read/write. Set this option if you want to emulate PC/XT hardware where the page registers are write-only.
#                                  enable slave pic: Enable slave PIC (IRQ 8-15). Set this to 0 if you want to emulate a PC/XT type arrangement with IRQ 0-7 and no IRQ 2 cascade.
#                                enable pc nmi mask: Enable PC/XT style NMI mask register (0xA0). Note that this option conflicts with the secondary PIC and will be ignored if the slave PIC is enabled.
#                             rom bios 8x8 CGA font: If set, or mainline compatible bios mapping, a legacy 8x8 CGA font (first 128 characters) is stored at 0xF000:0xFA6E. DOS programs that do not use INT 10h to locate fonts might require that font to be located there.
#                    rom bios video parameter table: If set, or mainline compatible bios mapping, DOSBox will emulate the video parameter table and assign that to INT 1Dh. If clear, table will not be provided.
#                 allow more than 640kb base memory: If set, and space is available, allow conventional memory to extend past 640KB.
#                                                    For example, if machine=cga, conventional memory can extend out to 0xB800 and provide up to 736KB of RAM.
#                                                    This allows you to emulate PC/XT style memory extensions.
#                     vesa lfb base scanline adjust: If non-zero, the VESA BIOS will report the linear framebuffer offset by this many scanlines.
#                                                    This does not affect the linear framebuffer's location. It only affects the linear framebuffer
#                                                    location reported by the VESA BIOS. Set to nonzero for DOS games with sloppy VESA graphics pointer management.
#                                                        MFX "Melvindale" (1996): Set this option to 2 to center the picture properly.
#                                allow hpel effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to change the horizontal pel (panning) register per scanline.
#                                                    Some early DOS demos use this to create waving or sinus effects on the picture. Not very many VGA
#                                                    chipsets allow this, so far, only ATI chipsets are known to support this effect. Disabled by default.
#                            allow hretrace effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to make the picture wavy by playing with the 'start horizontalretrace' register of the CRTC during the active picture. Some early DOS demos (Copper by Surprise!productions) need this option set for some demo effects to work. Disabled by default.
#                            hretrace effect weight: If emulating hretrace effects, this parameter adds 'weight' to the offset to smooth it out.
#                                                    the larger the number, the more averaging is applied. This is intended to emulate the inertia
#                                                    of the electron beam in a CRT monitor
#                                 vesa modelist cap: IF nonzero, the VESA modelist is capped so that it contains no more than the specified number of video modes.
#                                                    Set this option to a value between 8 to 32 if the DOS application has problems with long modelists or a fixed
#                                                    buffer for querying modes. Such programs may crash if given the entire modelist supported by DOSBox-X.
#                                                      Warcraft II by Blizzard ................ Set to a value between 8 and 16. This game has a fixed buffer that it
#                                                                                               reads the modelist into. DOSBox-X's normal modelist is too long and
#                                                                                               the game will overrun the buffer and crash without this setting.
#                         vesa modelist width limit: IF nonzero, VESA modes with horizontal resolution higher than the specified pixel count will not be listed.
#                                                    This is another way the modelist can be capped for DOS applications that have trouble with long modelists.
#                        vesa modelist height limit: IF nonzero, VESA modes with vertical resolution higher than the specified pixel count will not be listed.
#                                                    This is another way the modelist can be capped for DOS applications that have trouble with long modelists.
#                      vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp: If set, truecolor (16M color) VESA BIOS modes in the 0x100-0x11F range are 32bpp. If clear, they are 24bpp.
#                                                    Some DOS games and demos assume one bit depth or the other and do not enumerate VESA BIOS modes, which is why this
#                                                    option exists.
#                   allow low resolution vesa modes: If set, allow low resolution VESA modes (320x200x16/24/32bpp and so on). You could set this to false to simulate
#                                                    SVGA hardware with a BIOS that does not support the lowres modes for testing purposes.
#                            allow 32bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 32bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 24bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 24bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 16bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 16bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 15bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 15bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                             allow 8bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 8bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                             allow 4bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 4bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                              allow tty vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with text VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                      double-buffered line compare: This setting affects the VGA Line Compare register. Set to false (default value) to emulate most VGA behavior
#                                                    Set to true for the value to latch once at the start of the frame.
#                          ignore vblank wraparound: DOSBox-X can handle active display properly if games or demos reprogram vertical blanking to end in the active picture area.
#                                                    If the wraparound handling prevents the game from displaying properly, set this to false. Out of bounds vblank values will be ignored.
#                                                    
#                           enable vga resize delay: If the DOS game you are running relies on certain VGA raster tricks that affect active display area, enable this option.
#                                                    This adds a delay between VGA mode changes and window updates. It also means that if you are capturing a demo or game,
#                                                    that your capture will also show a few garbled frames at any point mode changes occur, which is why this option is disabled
#                                                    by default. If you intend to run certain DOS games and demos like DoWhackaDo, enable this option.
#  resize only on vga active display width increase: If set, changes to the Display End register of the CRTC do not trigger DOSBox to resize it's window
#                                                    IF the value written is less than the current value. Some demos like DoWhackaDo need this option set
#                                                    because of the way it's raster effects work. If the DOSBox window rapidly changes size during a demo
#                                                    try setting this option. Else, leave it turned off. Changes to other VGA CRTC registers will trigger

#             adlib force timer overflow on detect: If set, Adlib/OPL emulation will signal 'overflow' on timers after 50 I/O reads.

#                                                   NOTE: Technically this decreases emulation accuracy, however it also reflects the
#                                                         fact that DOSBox-X's I/O timing code needs some work to better match the

#                              dsp busy cycle duty: If emulating SB16 busy cycle, this value (0 to 100) controls the duty cycle of the busy cycle.
#                                                   If this option is set to -1, Sound Blaster emulation will choose a value automatically according

#                                                   They will not be able to request control however if the DOS kernel is configured to occupy the HMA (DOS=HIGH)
#                       hard drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) hard disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.

#           write plain iretf for debug interrupts: If true (default), the DOS kernel will create an alternate interrupt handler for debug interrupts INT 1 and INT 3
#                                                   that contain ONLY an IRETF instruction. If false, INT 1 and INT 3 will use the same default interrupt handler in

#              minimum dos initial private segment: In non-mainline mapping mode, where DOS structures are allocated from base memory, this sets the
#                                                   minimum segment value. Recommended value is 0x70. You may reduce the value down to 0x50 if freeing
#                                                   up more memory is important. Set to 0 for default.

#                                                   You can increase available DOS memory by reducing this value down to as low as 0x51, however
#                                                   setting it to low can cause some DOS programs to crash or run erratically, and some DOS games
#                                                   and demos to cause intermittent static noises when using Sound Blaster output. DOS programs

#                                                   Clearing this option can reclaim a small amount of conventional memory at the expense of

#                                                   Clearing this option can reclaim a small amount of conventional memory, but can also
#                                                   cause some DOS games to break especially if dynamic kernel allocation is enabled.
#                   enable dummy environment block: If set (default), allocate a dummy environment block at the base of conventional memory.
#                                                   You can clear this option to reclaim a small amount of conventional memory.
#           maximum environment block size on exec: Maximum environment block size to copy for child processes. Set to -1 for default.
#        additional environment block size on exec: When executing a program, compute the size of the parent block then add this amount to allow for a few additional variables.
#                                                   If the subprocesses will never add/modify the environment block, you can free up a few additional bytes by setting this to 0.
#                                                   Set to -1 for default setting.
#                       enable a20 on windows init: If set, DOSBox will enable the A20 gate when Windows 3.1/9x broadcasts the INIT message
#                                                   at startup. Windows 3.1 appears to make assumptions at some key points on startup about
#                                                   A20 that don't quite hold up and cause Windows 3.1 to crash when you set A20 emulation

#             zero memory on xms memory allocation: If set, memory returned by XMS allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                   DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
#                                                   related to uninitialized variables in extended memory. When enabled this option may
#                                                   incur a slight to moderate performance penalty.
#                                             dosv: Enable DOS/V emulation and specify which version to emulate. This option is intended for
#                                                   use with games or software originating from Asia that use the double byte character set

#                                                   Note that enabling DOS/V replaces 80x25 text mode (INT 10h mode 3) with a EGA/VGA graphics
#                                                   mode that emulates text mode to display the characters and may be incompatible with non-Asian

#                                             vcpi: If set and expanded memory is enabled, also emulate VCPI.
#                          unmask timer on disk io: If set, INT 21h emulation will unmask IRQ 0 (timer interrupt) when the application opens/closes/reads/writes files.
#                           zero int 67h if no ems: If ems=false, leave interrupt vector 67h zeroed out (default true).
#                                                   This is a workaround for games or demos that try to detect EMS by whether or not INT 67h is 0000:0000 rather than a proper test.
#                                                   This option also affects whether INT 67h is zeroed when booting a guest OS
#                            emm386 startup active: If set and expanded memory is set to emulate emm386, start the DOS machine with EMM386.EXE active
#                                                   (running the 16-bit DOS environment from within Virtual 8086 mode). If you will be running anything
#                                                   that involves a DOS extender you will also need to enable the VCPI interface as well.
#             zero memory on ems memory allocation: If set, memory returned by EMS allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                   DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
#                                                   related to uninitialized variables in expanded memory. When enabled this option may
#                                                   incur a slight to moderate performance penalty.
#                    ems system handle memory size: Amount of memory associated with system handle, in KB
#               ems system handle on even megabyte: If set, try to allocate the EMM system handle on an even megabyte.
#                                                   If the DOS game or demo fiddles with the A20 gate while using EMM386.EXE emulation in virtual 8086 mode, setting this option may help prevent crashes.
#                                                   However, forcing allocation on an even megabyte will also cause some extended memory fragmentation and reduce the
#                                                   overall amount of extended memory available to the DOS game depending on whether it expects large contiguous chunks
