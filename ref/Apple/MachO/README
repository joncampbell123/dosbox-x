Apple MachO header files.
It has become necessary to develop an in-tree tool to change MachO dylib dependency commands
because the official XCode tool has made itself useless with neurotic hand-writing over something
about link edit data failing to fill a __LINKEDIT segment, as if anybody really cares.

And I copied the header files in case Apple decides to remove them from standard XCode installs too!
