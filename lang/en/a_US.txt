  When there is only one piece of data left in the temporary storage area and it has been tested and confirmed to be the correct address, you can use this command to add the data from the temporary storage area to the formal data record area. A record description must be specified when adding. Example:
    A CASH
This action should only be performed when there is only one piece of data left in the temporary storage area and it has been tested and confirmed to be the correct address. Because the input area in debug mode cannot switch input methods, the record description can only consist of raw characters that can be input directly from the keyboard. If necessary, after saving the file, you can use a text editor to open the project file. Each record in the record area starts with the record description and uses as a separator. You can edit the description content before the symbol to change it to your desired language description. Please note that the description content must never contain the ` symbol, as this would compromise the integrity of the project file.
