  The system sets the search length based on your configured search conditions. Unless you specifically know the required search range, you do not need to modify this value. Command example:
    SL 0x10000  # Set the search length to 64KB
When the `SEG` value is not 0, the default search length is 64KB. When the `SEG` value is 0, the search length is 640KB or 1088KB, depending on whether HI MEMORY is enabled. If the game enters protected mode, the `SEG` value must be set to 0; setting it to any other value is invalid. The search length depends on the memory size set in the Dosbox-X configuration file.
