  If you lack a clear concept of how to search, you can use Snap mode. Note: this command is invalid if you are currently in search mode or already in Snap mode. Before executing this command, please use `SM`, `SEG`, and `OFF` to configure your search settings. These settings cannot be changed after entering Snap mode. Command example:
    SNAP
If a `SEG` value is set, after executing this command, the cheat tool will save the current state of the 64KB memory segment into a temporary file for future comparison. If the `SEG` value is set to 0, the cheat tool will save the state of all current memory into the temporary file. If the game you are running is a DOS-based game that enters protected mode (e.g., DOOM), it is recommended to set the memory size to 4MB in the Dosbox-X configuration. The default memory size in Dosbox-X is 16MB. Using a larger memory size will significantly increase the size of the temporary snapshot file.
