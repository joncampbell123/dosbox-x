  This command is only applicable under the following conditions:
    1. You have entered Snap mode using the `SNAP` command.
    2. You have performed at least one search using the `SU` or `SD` command.
After searching and knowing the current correct value, you can use this command to search further. Suppose at the beginning of the game, the quantity of a certain item is 1. The search command sequence would be as follows:
    SM WORD
    SEG 0x9117
    SNAP
Then press `[F5]` to return to the game, use the item, and re-enter debug mode.
    SD 1
The item quantity decreased by 1, so use `SD 1` to search. Dozens of results are found. Since the item quantity is now 0, use the following command next:
    SS 0
After this search, only the following two results remain:
1 : 53302 <==> 0xD036, value = 0
2 : 57340 <==> 0xDFFC, value = 0
At this point, you can use trial and error with the command:
    TW 9 1
This writes the value 9 to temporary storage entry 1. Press `[F5]` to return to the game and observe that the item quantity has changed to 9. Then use:
    TD 2
to delete the second entry from the temporary storage area. Finally, use:
    A Item_Name
    SAVE
to save the search result to the project file.
