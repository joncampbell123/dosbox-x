  Save the search settings and the temporary search storage area into a file with the specified name. The file will be stored in the "cheat/[project name]" folder, with the filename "[name].tmp". The typical use case for this command is at the beginning of a game, when you have multiple targets to search for. You can configure the search settings, perform a search using the `s` command, and then immediately use this command to save both the search settings and the temporary storage area. Afterwards, use `cls` to clear the temporary storage area, configure the search settings for the next target, perform another search with the `s` command, and save again. Command example:
    TS CASH
This will save the current settings and temporary storage area into a file named `CASH.tmp`.
