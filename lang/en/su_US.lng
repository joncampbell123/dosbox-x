:CHEAT_HELP_SU1
  After entering Snap mode and continuing the game, use this command to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU2
continue searching if the value you want to search for is **larger than** the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU3
value when entering "Snap mode" or **larger than the value from the last 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU4
search**. Usage is as follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU5
    SU
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU6
This method is suitable for values like health bars, where the exact value is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU7
unknown, allowing only fuzzy searches. This approach may require many attempts
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU8
 to find your target. Alternatively, you can use:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU9
    SU 10
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU10
This method is suitable when the exact numerical difference is known. For 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU11
example, if your money starts at 1000, use SNAP, then enter the game and earn 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU12
10 more. You can then enter debug mode and use `SU 10` to search quickly. If 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU13
the search results are still numerous, press `[F5]` to return to the game, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU14
wait for the value to change again, and then search once more.
