  Sometimes after searching, you might end up with only a few pieces of data that match the criteria. You can use this command to specify the memory segment to be displayed in the Data View to assist with your judgment. You only need to provide the address given to you by the search command as a parameter, and the system will automatically calculate the actual memory address for you. Suppose the following is the content displayed from one of my searches:
    1 : 9594 <==> 0x257A, Value = 100000
    2 : 60174 <==> 0xEB0E, Value = 100000
    3 : 60178 <==> 0xEB12, Value = 100000
    4 : 60276 <==> 0xEB74, Value = 100000
    5 : 60280 <==> 0xEB78, Value = 100000
    6 : 60378 <==> 0xEBDA, Value = 100000
    7 : 60382 <==> 0xEBDE, Value = 100000
    8 : 60480 <==> 0xEC40, Value = 100000
    9 : 60484 <==> 0xEC44, Value = 100000
If you want to see the memory condition around the 2nd entry, you can issue the following command:
    D 0xEB00
This will make the Data View start displaying data from address 0xEB00. You might wonder, since the address of the 2nd entry is clearly 0xEB0E, why would I start displaying from 0xEB00? I do this in the hope that all displayed addresses are aligned to end with a '0'. This makes it easier to calculate the address of any nearby data that you find interesting.
