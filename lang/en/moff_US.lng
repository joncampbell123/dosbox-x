  Set the offset address for memory mode. Unlike setting the offset to 0 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF2
during searches, here you need to set the offset address to the confirmed 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF3
target memory address. Then use the `MD` command to make the DATA VIEW window 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF4
display the memory content of this segment, and observe if the values in the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF5
nearby memory match certain attributes of the game character. Suppose I use 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF6
the following series of commands to set up the memory mode. This example is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF7
based on a specific game I am running. Since the game you are running is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF8
different, you should configure the settings according to your own game's 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF9
context.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF10
    MM DWORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF11
    MSEG 0x9117
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF12
    MOFF 0xEB0E
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF13
    MD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF14
You will see the following lines in the debug window:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF15
    9117:0000EB0E A0 86 01 00 A0 86 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF16
    9117:0000EB1E 64 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00

.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF19
Another attribute value in the game is 100, which converts to the hexadecimal 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF20
value `0x64`. You can see that the values at both `0xEB1E` and `0xEB2E` are:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF21
    64 00 00 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF22
Since this attribute value is relatively small, it is推测 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF23
(inferred/speculated) that its data type should be WORD. Use the following two
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF24
 commands to change the address and data size:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF25
    MM 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF26
    MOFF 0xEB2E # Already tested and confirmed to be this address
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF27
For subsequent steps, please refer to the `MD`, `MR`, `MS`, and `MA` command 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF28
instructions.
