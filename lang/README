Instructions:
The primary purpose of the help file is to provide explanations for editing cheat code additional commands. Its main goal is to help users better understand how to use the cheats. The content of the help file is mostly one long line (if necessary, it can be written across multiple lines; the conversion software will force a line break at each newline). Editing can be very difficult when the content is very long. It is recommended to use Notepad for editing (if the line is too long, Notepad will automatically wrap the text visually without inserting actual newline characters). After editing, copy the content into an editor that allows specifying the save encoding (such as Notepad++) and save it. The help file must be saved using UTF-8 without BOM encoding.

Step 1: Use a text editor to edit the .txt file. For the help file name, please refer to the .ext file, which contains the available additional commands for the cheats. These additional commands range from CHEAT_HELP_HELP to CHEAT_HELP_EXIT. If you need to edit the additional help for HELP, please name the help file help.txt. Unless absolutely necessary, the help file only needs one line. The conversion software will automatically handle line breaks. By default, each line is 78 characters long. CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters are counted as 2 characters each. If a line exceeds 78 characters, the conversion software will automatically move the remaining characters to the next line.

Step 2: Use the conversion software cvt.exe. Be sure to add the folder where the cvt program is located to your system's PATH environment variable. In the command prompt environment, change the current directory to this folder, then use the command "cvt filename" to perform the conversion. The converted file will be named "filename.lng". Use the help file's name as the filename here, without adding the .txt extension (the default input is a .txt file).

Step 3: Merge the .ext file and all the .lng files converted by the conversion software into the main language help file. In this example, it's zh_TW.lng. Then, copy the merged language file to the target folder. Therefore, you need to specify the destination folder. Please save your required destination folder path in a text file named target.cfg. This file can only contain exactly one line – not even one extra newline character – and should not end with a directory separator character. An incorrect target folder setting will cause the copy operation to fail.

The merging and copying process is handled by a batch file named cc.bat. You can modify this file as needed. For example, to process the zh_TW language file, use the following command (case sensitivity must be strictly observed): The first parameter is the folder containing the language file, and the second parameter is the locale of the language file. The naming rules for locales are irregular; please refer to the naming conventions used in the original Dosbox-X language files. Additionally, be sure to copy the original language files to their respective language folders. The batch file will merge the original language file with the .ext file and all the .lng files generated by cvt.

Example for Traditional Chinese:
cc zh TW

Example for Simplified Chinese:
cc zh CN

Example for English:
cc en US

Note: The .ext file must have one extra blank line at the end. Otherwise, the batch file will append the first line of %file2% directly to the last line of the .ext file, which will cause an error.

The target.cfg file must be saved using the local system's regional encoding, otherwise errors might occur during the copy process.
