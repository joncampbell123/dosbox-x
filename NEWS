For the latest version of DOSBox-X please go to the Releases page.

Also look at the file CHANGELOG for latest changes to the DOSBox-X source code.

Below are changes to DOSBox.

0.74-3
A security release for DOSBox 0.74:
- Fixed that a very long line inside a bat file would overflow the parsing 
  buffer (CVE-2019-7165 by Alexandre Bartel)
- Added a basic permission system so that a program running inside DOSBox 
  can't access the contents of /proc (e.g. /proc/self/mem) when / or /proc
  were (to be) mounted (CVE-2019-12594 by Alexandre Bartel)  
- Several other fixes for out of bounds access and buffer overflows.
- Some fixes to the OpenGL rendering.

It's recommended to use config -securemode when dealing with untrusted
files. 
See the Changelog for all the changes.

0.74-2
A maintenance release for DOSBox 0.74, which solves the following problems:

- Windows: Fix auto/max cycles algorithm on Windows 7, which helps with 
           stuttering audio.
- Mac OS X: Bring a 64 bit version and improve performance.
- Linux: Fix the 64bit dynrec cpu core and a lot of compilation problems. 
         Add patches for the WINE Team.

The game compatibility should be identical to 0.74.
See the Changelog for a full list of changes.
