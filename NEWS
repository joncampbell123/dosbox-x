- Fixed that a very long line inside a bat file would overflow the parsing 
  buffer (CVE-2019-7165 by Alexandre Bartel)
- Added a basic permission system so that a program running inside DOSBox 
  can't access the contents of /proc (e.g. /proc/self/mem) when / or /proc
  were (to be) mounted (CVE-2019-12594 by Alexandre Bartel)
