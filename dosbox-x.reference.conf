# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 0.83.19. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.
# To write out ALL options, use command 'config -all' with -wc or -writeconf options.

[sdl]
#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#    windowposition: Set the window position at startup in the positionX,positionY format (e.g.: 1300,200)
#           display: Specify a screen/display number to use for a multi-screen setup (0 = default).
#            output: What video system to use for output (openglnb = OpenGL nearest; openglpp = OpenGL perfect; ttf = TrueType font output).
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, ttf, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, ddraw, direct3d.
#       videodriver: Forces a video driver (e.g. windib/windows, directx, x11, fbcon, dummy, etc) for the SDL library to use.
#      transparency: Set the transparency of the DOSBox-X screen (both windowed and full-screen modes, on SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds).
#                      The valid value is from 0 (no transparency, the default setting) to 90 (high transparency).
#          maximize: If set, the DOSBox-X window will be maximized at start (SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds only; use fullscreen for TTF output).
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
#     middle_unlock: Whether you can press the middle mouse button to unlock the mouse when the mouse has been locked.
#                      If set to "manual", it works only with "autolock=false"; if set to "auto", it works only with "autolock=true".
#                      Possible values: none, manual, auto, both.
# clip_mouse_button: Select the mouse button or use arrow keys for the shared clipboard copy/paste function.
#                      The default mouse button is "right", which means using the right mouse button to select text, copy to and paste from the host clipboard.
#                      Set to "middle" to use the middle mouse button, "arrows" to use arrow keys instead of a mouse button, or "none" to disable this feature.
#                      For "arrows", press Home key (or Fn+Shift+Left on Mac laptops) to start selection, and End key (or Fn+Shift+Right on Mac laptops) to end selection.
#                      Possible values: none, middle, right, arrows.
# clip_key_modifier: Change the keyboard modifier for the shared clipboard copy/paste function using a mouse button or arrow keys.
#                      The default modifier is "shift" (both left and right shift keys). Set to "none" if no modifier is desired.
#                      Possible values: none, ctrl, lctrl, rctrl, alt, lalt, ralt, shift, lshift, rshift, ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, lctrlalt, lctrlshift, laltshift, rctrlalt, rctrlshift, raltshift.
#   clip_paste_bios: Specify whether to use BIOS keyboard functions for the clipboard pasting instead of the keystroke method.
#                      For pasting clipboard text into Windows 3.x/9x applications (e.g. Notepad), make sure to use the keystroke method.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, default.
#  clip_paste_speed: Set keyboard speed for pasting text from the shared clipboard.
#                      If the default setting of 30 causes lost keystrokes, increase the number.
#                      Or experiment with decreasing the number for applications that accept keystrokes quickly.
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#   usesystemcursor: Use the mouse cursor of the host system instead of drawing a DOS mouse cursor. Activated when the mouse is not locked.
#   mouse_emulation: When is mouse emulated ?
#                      integration: when not locked
#                      locked:      when locked
#                      always:      every time
#                      never:       at no time
#                      If disabled, the mouse position in DOSBox-X is exactly where the host OS reports it.
#                      When using a high DPI mouse, the emulation of mouse movement can noticeably reduce the
#                      sensitiveness of your device, i.e. the mouse is slower but more precise.
#                      Possible values: integration, locked, always, never.
#   mouse_wheel_key: Convert mouse wheel movements into keyboard presses such as arrow keys.
#                      0: disabled; 1: up/down arrows; 2: left/right arrows; 3: PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      4: Ctrl+up/down arrows; 5: Ctrl+left/right arrows; 6: Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      7: Ctrl+W/Z, as supported by text editors like WordStar and MS-DOS EDIT.
#                      Putting a minus sign in front will disable the conversion for guest systems.
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.
#                      If set to "auto" (default), it is enabled for SDL1 and non-US keyboards.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          titlebar: Change the string displayed in the DOSBox-X title bar.
#         showbasic: If set, DOSBox-X will show basic information including the DOSBox-X version number and current running speed in the title bar.
#       showdetails: If set, DOSBox-X will show the cycles count (FPS) and emulation speed relative to realtime in the title bar.
#          showmenu: Whether to show the menu bar (if supported). Default true.

[dosbox]
#                  language: Select a language file for DOSBox-X to use. Encoded with either UTF-8 or a DOS code page.
#                              You can set code page either in the language file or with "country" setting in [config] section.
#                     title: Additional text to place in the title bar of the window.
#              fastbioslogo: If set, DOSBox-X will skip the BIOS screen by activating fast BIOS logo mode (without 1-second pause).
#               startbanner: If set (default), DOSBox-X will display the welcome banner when it starts.
#          bannercolortheme: You can specify a different background color theme for the welcome banner from the default one.
#                              Possible values: default, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white.
#                 dpi aware: Set this option (auto by default) to indicate to your OS that DOSBox-X is DPI aware.
#                              If it is not set, Windows Vista/7/8/10 and higher may upscale the DOSBox-X window
#                              on higher resolution monitors which is probably not what you want.
#                              Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#              quit warning: Set this option to indicate whether DOSBox-X should show a warning message when the user tries to close its window.
#                              If set to auto (default), DOSBox-X will warn if a DOS program, game or a guest system is currently running.
#                              If set to autofile, DOSBox-X will warn if there are open file handles or a guest system is currently running.
#                              Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto, autofile.
#  working directory option: Select an option for DOSBox-X's working directory when it runs.
#                              autoprompt: DOSBox-X will auto-decide whether to prompt for a working directory.
#                              config: DOSBox-X will use the primary config file directory as the working directory.
#                              custom: Specify a working directory via the "working directory default" option.
#                              default: Similar to autoprompt, but DOSBox-X will ask whether to save the selected folder.
#                              force: Similar to "custom", while overriding -defaultdir command-line option if used.
#                              noprompt: DOSBox-X uses the current directory and never prompts for a working directory.
#                              program: DOSBox-X will use the DOSBox-X program directory as the working directory.
#                              prompt: DOSBox-X will always ask the user to select a working directory when it runs.
#                              userconfig: DOSBox-X will use its user configuration directory as the working directory.
#                              Possible values: autoprompt, config, custom, default, force, noprompt, program, prompt, userconfig.
# working directory default: The default directory to act as DOSBox-X's working directory. See also the setting "working directory option".
#                              For working directory option=prompt, the specified directory becomes the default directory for the folder selection.
#     show advanced options: If set, the Configuration Tool will display all config options (including advanced ones) by default.
#       resolve config path: If set to true, DOSBox-X will resolve options containing paths in the config file (except [autoexec] section).
#                              This includes environment variables (%VAR% [DOS/Windows] or ${VAR} [Linux/macOS] and tilde (~) in Linux/macOS.
#                              If set to dosvar, DOSBox-X forces to resolve DOS-style environment variables (%VAR%) in all platforms (and tilde).
#                              If set to tilde, DOSBox-X will only resolve tilde (~) in Linux/macOS but will not resolve environment variables.
#                              Possible values: true, false, dosvar, tilde, 1, 0.
#                   hostkey: By default, DOSBox-X uses the mapper-defined host key, which defaults to F11 on Windows and F12 on other platforms.
#                              You may alternatively specify a host key with this setting and bypass the host key as defined in the mapper.
#                              This can also be done from the menu ("Main" => "Select host key").
#                              Possible values: ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, mapper.
#           mapper send key: Select the key the mapper SendKey function will send.
#                              Possible values: winlogo, winmenu, alttab, ctrlesc, ctrlbreak, ctrlaltdel.
#                       ime: Enables support for the system input methods (IME) for inputting characters in Windows and Linux builds.
#                              If set to auto, this feature is only enabled if DOSBox-X starts with a Chinese/Japanese/Korean code page.
#                              Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          synchronize time: If set, DOSBox-X will try to automatically synchronize time with the host, unless you decide to change the date/time manually.
#                   machine: The type of machine DOSBox-X tries to emulate.
#                              Possible values: hercules, cga, cga_mono, cga_rgb, cga_composite, cga_composite2, tandy, pcjr, pcjr_composite, pcjr_composite2, ega, jega, vgaonly, svga_s3, svga_s386c928, svga_s3vision864, svga_s3vision868, svga_s3trio32, svga_s3trio64, svga_s3trio64v+, svga_s3virge, svga_s3virgevx, svga_et3000, svga_et4000, svga_paradise, vesa_nolfb, vesa_oldvbe, vesa_oldvbe10, amstrad, pc98, pc9801, pc9821, fm_towns, mcga, mda.
#                  captures: Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
#                  autosave: Enable the auto-save state feature. Specify a time interval in seconds, and optionally a save slot or start and end save slots.
#                              For example, "autosave=10 11-20" will set a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the save slots used will be between 11 and 20.
#                              You can additionally specify up to 9 programs for this feature, e.g. "autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35" for "EDIT" and "EDITOR".
#                              Putting a minus sign (-) before the time interval causes the auto-saving function to not be activated at start.
#                  saveslot: Select the default save slot (1-100) to save/load states.
#                  savefile: Select the default save file to save/load states. If specified it will be used instead of the save slot.
#                saveremark: If set, the save state feature will ask users to enter remarks when saving a state.
#            forceloadstate: If set, DOSBox-X will load a saved state even if it finds there is a mismatch in the DOSBox-X version, machine type, program name and/or the memory size.
#                       a20: A20 gate emulation mode.
#                              The on/off/on_fake/off_fake options are intended for testing and debugging DOS development,
#                              or to emulate obscure hardware, or to work around potential extended memory problems with DOS programs.
#                              on_fake/off_fake are intended to test whether a program carries out a memory test to ensure the A20
#                              gate is set as intended (as HIMEM.SYS does). If it goes by the gate bit alone, it WILL crash.
#                              This parameter is also changeable from the builtin A20GATE command.
#                                fast                         Emulate A20 gating by remapping the first 64KB @ 1MB boundary (fast, mainline DOSBox behavior)
#                                mask                         Emulate A20 gating by masking memory I/O address (accurate)
#                                off                          Lock A20 gate off (Software/OS cannot enable A20)
#                                on                           Lock A20 gate on (Software/OS cannot disable A20)
#                                off_fake                     Lock A20 gate off but allow bit to toggle (hope your DOS game tests the HMA!)
#                                on_fake                      Lock A20 gate on but allow bit to toggle
#                   memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox-X has in megabytes.
#                              This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#                              although other games and applications may require a higher value.
#                              Programs that use 286 protected mode like Windows 3.0 in Standard Mode may crash with more than 15MB.
#                nocachedir: If set, MOUNT commands will mount with -nocachedir (disable directory caching) by default.
#               freesizecap: If set to "cap" (="true"), the value of MOUNT -freesize will apply only if the actual free size is greater than the specified value.
#                              If set to "relative", the value of MOUNT -freesize will change relative to the specified value.
#                              If set to "fixed" (="false"), the value of MOUNT -freesize will be a fixed one to be reported all the time.
#                              Possible values: true, false, fixed, relative, cap, 2, 1, 0.

#                         'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in disproportional image
#                         'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction (default), resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel ratio is not 4:3
#                     'true':
#                         'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output to proportional 4:3 image
#                             In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image is upscaled).
#                             Should have none to negligible impact on performance, mostly being done in hardware
#                             For the pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to enable this whenever the emulated display has an aspect ratio of 4:3
#                         'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct output to 4:3 ratio)
#                             Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x will work poorly
#                             Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact on performance
#                             When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of the above apply
#                   Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#          char9: Allow 9-pixel wide text mode fonts instead of 8-pixel wide fonts.
#           euro: Display Euro symbol instead of the specified ASCII character (33-255).
#                   For example, setting it to 128 allows Euro symbol to be displayed instead of C-cedilla.
#     doublescan: If set, doublescanned output emits two scanlines for each source line, in the
#                   same manner as the actual VGA output (320x200 is rendered as 640x400 for example).
#                   If clear, doublescanned output is rendered at the native source resolution (320x200 as 320x200).
#                   This affects the raster PRIOR to the software or hardware scalers. Choose wisely.
#                   For pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to turn this option off.
#         scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. If 'forced' is appended,
#                   then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#                   To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                   To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                   Scalers should work with most output options, but they are ignored for openglpp and TrueType font outputs.
#                   Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.
#       glshader: Path to GLSL shader source to use with OpenGL output ("none" to disable, or "default" for default shader).
#                   Can be either an absolute path, a file in the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X configuration directory,
#                   or one of the built-in shaders (e.g. "sharp" for the pixel-perfect scaling mode):
#                   advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp.
#    pixelshader: Set Direct3D pixel shader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory). If 'forced' is appended,
#                   then the pixel shader will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#        autofit: Best fits image to window
#                   - Intended for output=direct3d, fullresolution=original, aspect=true
# monochrome_pal: Specify the color of monochrome display.
#                   Possible values: green, amber, gray, white

#                                 need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#                 'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to

#                 For example, setting it to "consola" or "consola.ttf" will use Consola font (included in Windows); similar for other TTF fonts.
#                 Additionally, OTF fonts (e.g. OratorStd.otf), .FON fonts (e.g. vgasys.fon), and .TTC fonts (e.g. msgothic.ttc) are also supported.
#                 To display Chinese/Japanese/Korean text in these code pages, a font with CJK characters is needed (e.g. GNU Unifont or Sarasa Gothic).
#     fontbold: You can optionally specify a bold TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the bold text style.
#                 It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual bold font will be used for the bold style.
#                 For example, setting it to "consolab" or "consolab.ttf" will use the Consolab font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#     fontital: You can optionally specify an italic TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the italic text style.
#                 It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual italic font will be used for the italic style.
#                 For example, setting it to "consolai" or "consolai.ttf" will use the Consolai font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#     fontboit: You can optionally specify a bold italic TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the bold italic text style.
#                 It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual bold-italic font will be used for the bold-italic style.
#                 For example, setting it to "consolaz" or "consolaz.ttf" will use the Consolaz font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#       colors: Specifies a color scheme to use for the TTF output by supply all 16 color values in RGB: (r,g,b) or hexadecimal as in HTML: #RRGGBB
#                 The original DOS colors (0-15): #000000 #0000aa #00aa00 #00aaaa #aa0000 #aa00aa #aa5500 #aaaaaa #555555 #5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 #ffffff
#                 gray scaled color scheme: (0,0,0)  #0e0e0e  (75,75,75) (89,89,89) (38,38,38) (52,52,52) #717171 #c0c0c0 #808080 (28,28,28) (150,150,150) (178,178,178) (76,76,76) (104,104,104) (226,226,226) (255,255,255)
# outputswitch: Specifies the output that DOSBox-X should switch to from the TTF output when a graphical mode is requiested, or auto for automatic selection.
#                 Possible values: auto, surface, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, direct3d.
#      winperc: Specifies the window percentage for the TTF output (100 = full screen). Ignored if the ptsize setting is specified.
#       ptsize: Specifies the font point size for the TTF output. If specified (minimum: 9), it will override the winperc setting.
#         lins: Specifies the number of rows on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#         cols: Specifies the number of columns on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#  righttoleft: If set, DOSBox-X will display text from right to left instead of left to right on the screen for the TTF output.
#                 This is especially useful for languages which use right-to-left scripts (such as Arabic and Hebrew).
#           wp: You can specify a word processor for the TTF output and optionally also a version number for the word processor.
#                 Supported word processors are WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite, FE=FastEdit, and an optional version number.
#                 For example, WP6 will set the word processor as WordPerfect 6, and XY4 will set the word processor as XyWrite 4.
#                 Word processor-specific features like on-screen text styles and 512-character font will be enabled based on this.
#         bold: If set, DOSBox-X will display bold text in visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#                 This is done either with the actual bold font specified by the fontbold option, or by making it bold automatically.
#       italic: If set, DOSBox-X will display italicized text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#                 This is done either with the actual italic font specified by the fontital option, or by slanting the characters automatically.
#    underline: If set, DOSBox-X will display underlined text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#    strikeout: If set, DOSBox-X will display strikeout text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#    printfont: If set, DOSBox-X will force to use the current TrueType font (set via font option) for printing in addition to displaying.
#     autodbcs: If set, DOSBox-X enables Chinese/Japanese/Korean DBCS (double-byte) characters when these code pages are active by default.
#                 Only applicable when using a DBCS code page (932: Japanese, 936: Simplified Chinese; 949: Korean; 950: Traditional Chinese)
#                 This applies to both the display and printing of these characters (see the [printer] section for details of the latter).
#       blinkc: If set to true, the cursor blinks for the TTF output; setting it to false will turn the blinking off.
#                 You can also change the blinking rate by setting an integer between 1 (fastest) and 7 (slowest), or 0 for no cursor.
#     dosvfunc: If set, enables FEP control to function for Japanese DOS/V applications, and changes the blinking of character attributes to high brightness.

# shell configuration as commands: Allow entering dosbox-x.conf configuration parameters as shell commands to get and set settings.
#                                    This is disabled by default to avoid conflicts between commands and executables.
#                                    It is recommended to get and set dosbox-x.conf settings using the CONFIG command instead.
#                                    Compatibility with DOSBox SVN can be improved by enabling this option.
#                             hma: Report through XMS that HMA exists (not necessarily available)
#      hard drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) hard disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                    Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 (default) to use a reasonable limit.
#                                    The disk I/O performance as in DOSBox SVN can be achieved by setting this to 0.
#                        ansi.sys: If set (by default), ANSI.SYS emulation is on. If clear, ANSI.SYS is not emulated and will not appear to be installed.
#                                    NOTE: This option has no effect in PC-98 mode where MS-DOS systems integrate ANSI.SYS into the DOS kernel.
#                     log console: If set, log DOS CON output to the log file. Setting to "quiet" will log DOS CON output only (no debugging output).
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, quiet.
#                           share: Report SHARE.EXE as resident. This will allow file locking to be performed, although not all SHARE functions are emulated.
#               file access tries: If a positive integer is set, DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock files directly on mounted local drives for the specified number of times without caching before failing on Windows systems.
#                                    For networked database applications (e.g. dBase, FoxPro, etc), it is strongly recommended to set this to e.g. 3 for correct operations.
#              network redirector: Report DOS network redirector as resident. This will allow the host name to be returned unless the secure mode is enabled.
#                                    You can also directly access UNC network paths in the form \\MACHINE\SHARE even if they are not mounted as drives on Windows systems.
#                                    Set either "ipx=true" in [ipx] section or "ne2000=true" in [ne2000] section for a full network redirector environment.
#                minimum mcb free: Minimum free segment value to leave free. At startup, the DOS kernel will allocate memory
#                                    up to this point. This can be used to deal with EXEPACK issues or DOS programs that cannot
#                                    be loaded too low in memory. If you want more free conventional memory to be reported,
#                                    you can for example set its value to 1.
#                             ems: Enable EMS support. The default (=true) provides the best
#                                    compatibility but certain applications may run better with
#                                    other choices, or require EMS support to be disabled (=false)
#                                    to work at all.
#                                    Possible values: true, emsboard, emm386, false, 1, 0.
#                             umb: Enable UMB support.
#                    quick reboot: If set, the DOS restart call will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated DOS or guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine.
#                                    
#                             ver: Set DOS version. Specify as major.minor format. A single number is treated as the major version (compatible with LFN support). Common settings are:
#                                    auto (or unset)                  Pick a DOS kernel version automatically
