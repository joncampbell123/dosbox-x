# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 0.83.5. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.
# To write out ALL options, use command 'config -all' with -wc or -writeconf options.

[sdl]
#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#            output: What video system to use for output.
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, ddraw.
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
# autolock_feedback: Autolock status feedback type, i.e. visual, auditive, none.
#                      Possible values: none, beep, flash.
# clip_key_modifier: Change the keyboard modifier for the Windows clipboard copy/paste function using the right mouse button.
#                      The default modifier is "shift". Set to "none" if no modifier is desired, or "disabled" to disable this feature.
#                      Possible values: none, alt, lalt, ralt, ctrl, lctrl, rctrl, shift, lshift, rshift, disabled.
#  clip_paste_speed: Set keyboard speed for pasting from the Windows clipboard.
#                      If the default setting of 20 causes lost keystrokes, increase the number.
#                      Or experiment with decreasing the number for applications that accept keystrokes quickly.
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#   mouse_emulation: When is mouse emulated ?
#                      integration: when not locked
#                      locked:      when locked
#                      always:      every time
#                      never:       at no time
#                      If disabled, the mouse position in DOSBox-X is exactly where the host OS reports it.
#                      When using a high DPI mouse, the emulation of mouse movement can noticeably reduce the
#                      sensitiveness of your device, i.e. the mouse is slower but more precise.
#                      Possible values: integration, locked, always, never, 0, 1, 2, 3.
#   mouse_wheel_key: Convert mouse wheel movements into keyboard presses such as arrow keys.
#                      0: disabled; 1: up/down arrows; 2: left/right arrows; 3: PgUp/PgDn keys.
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#   mapperfile_sdl2: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from (SDL2 builds). Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.
#                      If set to "auto" (default), it is enabled for SDL1 and non-US keyboards.
#                      Possible values: true, false, auto.
#          overscan: Width of overscan border (0 to 10). (works only if output=surface)
#          titlebar: Change the string displayed in the DOSBox-X title bar.
#          showmenu: Whether to show the menu bar (if supported). Default true.

#                                                      suffered from memory aliasing for various technical reasons. If the software you are
#                                                      trying to run assumes aliasing, or otherwise plays cheap tricks with paging,
#                                                      enabling this option can help. Note that enabling this option can cause slight performance degredation. Set to 0 to disable.
#                                                      Recommended values when enabled:
#                                                          24: 16MB aliasing. Common on 386SX systems (CPU had 24 external address bits)
#                                                              or 386DX and 486 systems where the CPU communicated directly with the ISA bus (A24-A31 tied off)
#                                                          26: 64MB aliasing. Some 486s had only 26 external address bits, some motherboards tied off A26-A31
#                                        nocachedir: If set, MOUNT commands will mount with -nocachedir by default.
#                                       freesizecap: If set, the value of MOUNT -freesize will be applied only if the actual free size is greater than the specified value.
#                 leading colon write protect image: If set, BOOT and IMGMOUNT commands will put an image file name with a leading colon (:) in write-protect mode.
#                            vga bios size override: VGA BIOS size override. Override the size of the VGA BIOS (normally 32KB in compatible or 12KB in non-compatible).
# video bios dont duplicate cga first half rom font: If set, save 4KB of EGA/VGA ROM space by pointing to the copy in the ROM BIOS of the first 128 chars
#    video bios always offer 14-pixel high rom font: If set, video BIOS will always carry the 14-pixel ROM font. If clear, 14-pixel rom font will not be offered except for EGA/VGA emulation.
#    video bios always offer 16-pixel high rom font: If set, video BIOS will always carry the 16-pixel ROM font. If clear, 16-pixel rom font will not be offered except for VGA emulation.
#        video bios enable cga second half rom font: If set, and emulating CGA/PCjr/Tandy, automatically provide the second half of the 8x8 ROM font.
#                                                      This setting is ignored for EGA/VGA emulation. If not set, you will need a utility like GRAFTABL.COM to load the second half of the ROM font for graphics.
#                                                      NOTE: if you disable the 14 & 16 pixel high font AND the second half when machine=cga, you will disable video bios completely.
#                                         forcerate: Force the VGA framerate to a specific value(ntsc, pal, or specific hz), no matter what
#                                     sierra ramdac: Whether or not to emulate a Sierra or compatible RAMDAC at port 3C6h-3C9h.
#                                                      Some DOS games expect to access port 3C6h to enable highcolor/truecolor SVGA modes on older chipsets.
#                                                      Disable if you wish to emulate SVGA hardware that lacks a RAMDAC or (depending on the chipset) does
#                                                      not emulate a RAMDAC that is accessible through port 3C6h. This option has no effect for non-VGA video hardware.
#                            sierra ramdac lock 565: When emulating High Sierra highcolor RAMDAC, assume 5:6:5 at all times if set. Else,
#                                                      bit 6 of the DAC command selects between 5:5:5 and 5:6:5. Set this option for demos or
#                                                      games that got the command byte wrong (MFX Transgrassion 2) or any other demo that is
#                                                      not rendering highcolor 16bpp correctly.
#                              page flip debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC display offset registers were written.
#                                                      This can be used to help diagnose whether or not the DOS game is page flipping properly according to vertical retrace if the display on-screen is flickering.
#                  vertical retrace poll debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse green dotted line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC status port (0x3DA) was read.
#                                                      This can be used to help diagnose whether the DOS game is propertly waiting for vertical retrace.
#                                           cgasnow: When machine=cga, determines whether or not to emulate CGA snow in 80x25 text mode
#                            vga 3da undefined bits: VGA status port 3BA/3DAh only defines bits 0 and 3. This setting allows you to assign a bit pattern to the undefined bits.
#                                                      The purpose of this hack is to deal with demos that read and handle port 3DAh in ways that might crash if all are zero.
#                    unmask timer on int 10 setmode: If set, INT 10h will unmask IRQ 0 (timer) when setting video modes.
#                    unmask keyboard on int 16 read: If set, INT 16h will unmask IRQ 1 (keyboard) when asked to read keyboard input.
#                                                      It is strongly recommended that you set this option if running Windows 3.11 Windows for Workgroups in DOSBox-X.
#   int16 keyboard polling undocumented cf behavior: If set, INT 16h function AH=01h will also set/clear the carry flag depending on whether input was available.
#                                                      There are some old DOS games and demos that rely on this behavior to sense keyboard input, and this behavior
#                                                      has been verified to occur on some old (early 90s) BIOSes.
#                               allow port 92 reset: If set (default), allow the application to reset the CPU through port 92h
#                                    enable port 92: Emulate port 92h (PS/2 system control port A). If you want to emulate a system that pre-dates the PS/2, set to 0.
#                         enable 1st dma controller: Emulate 1st (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a system that lacks DMA (PCjr and some Tandy systems)
#                         enable 2nd dma controller: Emulate 2nd (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a PC/XT system without 16-bit DMA.
#                                                      Note: mainline DOSBox automatically disables 16-bit DMA when machine=cga or machine=hercules, while DOSBox-X does not.
#                       allow dma address decrement: If set, allow increment & decrement modes as specified in the 8237 datasheet.
#                                                      If clear, always increment the address (as if to emulate clone 8237 implementations that skipped the inc/dec bit).
#                    enable 128k capable 16-bit dma: If true, DMA controller emulation models ISA hardware that permits 16-bit DMA to span 128KB.
#                                                      If false, DMA controller emulation models PCI hardware that limits 16-bit DMA to 64KB boundaries.
#                                                      If auto, the choice is made according to other factors in hardware emulation
#                                                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                   enable dma extra page registers: If set, emulate the extra page registers (I/O ports 0x80, 0x84-0x86, 0x88, 0x8C-0x8E), like actual hardware.
#                                                      Note that mainline DOSBox behavior is to NOT emulate these registers.
#                     dma page registers write-only: Normally (on AT hardware) the DMA page registers are read/write. Set this option if you want to emulate PC/XT hardware where the page registers are write-only.
#                cascade interrupt never in service: If set, PIC emulation will never mark cascade interrupt as in service. This is OFF by default. It is a hack for troublesome games.
#               cascade interrupt ignore in service: If true, PIC emulation will allow slave pic interrupts even if the cascade interrupt is still "in service" (common PC-98 behavior)
#                                                      If false, PIC emulation will consider cascade in-service state when deciding which interrupt to signal (common IBM PC behavior)
#                                                      If auto, setting is chosen based on machine type and other configuration.
#                                                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                                  enable slave pic: Enable slave PIC (IRQ 8-15). Set this to 0 if you want to emulate a PC/XT type arrangement with IRQ 0-7 and no IRQ 2 cascade.
#                                enable pc nmi mask: Enable PC/XT style NMI mask register (0xA0). Note that this option conflicts with the secondary PIC and will be ignored if the slave PIC is enabled.
#                             rom bios 8x8 CGA font: If set, or mainline DOSBox compatible BIOS mapping, a legacy 8x8 CGA font (first 128 characters) is stored at 0xF000:0xFA6E. DOS programs that do not use INT 10h to locate fonts might require that font to be located there.
#                    rom bios video parameter table: If set, or mainline DOSBox compatible BIOS mapping, DOSBox-X will emulate the video parameter table and assign that to INT 1Dh. If clear, table will not be provided.
#                 allow more than 640kb base memory: If set, and space is available, allow conventional memory to extend past 640KB.
#                                                      For example, if machine=cga, conventional memory can extend out to 0xB800 and provide up to 736KB of RAM.
#                                                      This allows you to emulate PC/XT style memory extensions.
#                        int 10h points at vga bios: If set, INT 10h points at the VGA BIOS. If clear, INT 10h points into the system BIOS. This option only affects EGA/VGA/SVGA emulation.
#                                                      This option is needed for some older DOS applications that make additional checks before detecting EGA/VGA hardware (SuperCalc).
#               vesa zero buffer on get information: This setting affects VESA BIOS function INT 10h AX=4F00h. If set, the VESA BIOS will zero the
#                                                      256-byte buffer defined by the standard at ES:DI, then fill in the structure. If clear, only
#                                                      the structure members will be filled in, and memory outside the initial 20-32 bytes will remain
#                                                      unmodified. This setting is ON by default. Some very early 1990s DOS games that support VESA
#                                                      BIOS standards may need this setting turned OFF if the programmer did not provide enough space
#                                                      for the entire 256 byte structure and the game crashes if it detects VESA BIOS extensions.
#                                                      Needed for:
#                                                        GETSADAM.EXE
#                     vesa lfb base scanline adjust: If non-zero, the VESA BIOS will report the linear framebuffer offset by this many scanlines.
#                                                      This does not affect the linear framebuffer's location. It only affects the linear framebuffer
#                                                      location reported by the VESA BIOS. Set to nonzero for DOS games with sloppy VESA graphics pointer management.
#                                                          MFX "Melvindale" (1996): Set this option to 2 to center the picture properly.
#            vesa map non-lfb modes to 128kb region: If set, VESA BIOS SVGA modes will be set to map 128KB of video memory to A0000-BFFFF instead of
#                                                      64KB at A0000-AFFFF. This does not affect the SVGA window size or granularity.
#                                                      Some games or demoscene productions assume that they can render into the next SVGA window/bank
#                                                      by writing to video memory beyond the current SVGA window address and will not appear correctly
#                                                      without this option.
#                                allow hpel effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to change the horizontal pel (panning) register per scanline.
#                                                      Some early DOS demos use this to create waving or sinus effects on the picture. Not very many VGA
#                                                      chipsets allow this, so far, only ATI chipsets are known to support this effect. Disabled by default.
#                            allow hretrace effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to make the picture wavy by playing with the 'start horizontalretrace' register of the CRTC during the active picture. Some early DOS demos (Copper by Surprise!productions) need this option set for some demo effects to work. Disabled by default.
#                            hretrace effect weight: If emulating hretrace effects, this parameter adds 'weight' to the offset to smooth it out.
#                                                      the larger the number, the more averaging is applied. This is intended to emulate the inertia
#                                                      of the electron beam in a CRT monitor
#                                 vesa modelist cap: IF nonzero, the VESA modelist is capped so that it contains no more than the specified number of video modes.
#                         vesa modelist width limit: IF nonzero, VESA modes with horizontal resolution higher than the specified pixel count will not be listed.
#                                                      This is another way the modelist can be capped for DOS applications that have trouble with long modelists.
#                        vesa modelist height limit: IF nonzero, VESA modes with vertical resolution higher than the specified pixel count will not be listed.
#                                                      This is another way the modelist can be capped for DOS applications that have trouble with long modelists.
#         vesa vbe put modelist in vesa information: If set, the VESA modelist is placed in the VESA information structure itself when the DOS application
#                                                      queries information on the VESA BIOS. Setting this option may help with some games, though it limits
#                                                      the mode list reported to the DOS application.
#                      vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp: If set, truecolor (16M color) VESA BIOS modes in the 0x100-0x11F range are 32bpp. If clear, they are 24bpp.
#                                                      Some DOS games and demos assume one bit depth or the other and do not enumerate VESA BIOS modes, which is why this
#                                                      option exists.
#                   allow low resolution vesa modes: If set, allow low resolution VESA modes (320x200x16/24/32bpp and so on). You could set this to false to simulate
#                                                      SVGA hardware with a BIOS that does not support the lowres modes for testing purposes.
#                   allow explicit 24bpp vesa modes: If set, additional 24bpp modes are listed in the modelist regardless whether modes 0x100-0x11F are
#                                                      configured to be 24bpp or 32bpp. Setting this option can provide the best testing and development
#                                                      environment for new retro DOS code. If clear, 24bpp will only be available in the 0x100-0x11F range
#                                                      if the "vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp" is false. Setting to false helps to emulate typical SVGA
#                                                      hardware in which either 24bpp is supported, or 32bpp is supported, but not both. Disabled by default.
#                  allow high definition vesa modes: If set, offer HD video modes in the VESA modelist (such as 1280x720 aka 720p or 1920x1080 aka 1080p).

#                           enable vga resize delay: If the DOS game you are running relies on certain VGA raster tricks that affect active display area, enable this option.
#                                                      This adds a delay between VGA mode changes and window updates. It also means that if you are capturing a demo or game,
#                                                      that your capture will also show a few garbled frames at any point mode changes occur, which is why this option is disabled
#                                                      by default. If you intend to run certain DOS games and demos like DoWhackaDo, enable this option.
#  resize only on vga active display width increase: If set, changes to the Display End register of the CRTC do not trigger DOSBox-X to resize its window

#                                                      because of the way its raster effects work. If the DOSBox-X window rapidly changes size during a demo
#                                                      try setting this option. Else, leave it turned off. Changes to other VGA CRTC registers will trigger

#                   vga palette update on full load: If set, all three bytes of the palette entry must be loaded before taking the color,
#                                                      which is fairly typical SVGA behavior. If not set, partial changes are allowed.
#             ignore odd-even mode in non-cga modes: Some demoscene productions use VGA Mode X but accidentally enable odd/even mode.
#                                                      Setting this option can correct for that and render the demo properly.
#                                                      This option forces VGA emulation to ignore odd/even mode except in text and CGA modes.
#                        ignore extended memory bit: Some DOS applications use VGA 256-color mode but accidentally clear the extended memory

#               frameskip: How many frames DOSBox-X skips before drawing one.
#              alt render: If set, use a new experimental rendering engine
#                  aspect: Aspect ratio correction mode. Can be set to the following values:
#                              'false' (default):
#                                  'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in disproportional image
#                                  'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction (default), resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel ratio is not 4:3
#                              'true':
#                                  'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output to proportional 4:3 image
#                                      In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image is upscaled).
#                                      Should have none to negligible impact on performance, mostly being done in hardware
#                                  'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct output to 4:3 ratio)
#                                      Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x will work poorly
#                                      Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact on performance
#                                      When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of the above apply
#                            Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#                   char9: Allow 9-pixel wide text mode fonts.
#                    euro: Display Euro symbol instead of the specified ASCII character (33-255).
#                            For example, setting it to 128 allows Euro symbol to be displayed instead of C-cedilla.

#                            same manner as the actual VGA output (320x200 is rendered as 640x400 for example).
#                            If clear, doublescanned output is rendered at the native source resolution (320x200 as 320x200).
#                            This affects the raster PRIOR to the software or hardware scalers. Choose wisely.
#                            
#                  scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. If 'forced' is appended,
#                            then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#                            To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                            To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                            Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.
#              xbrz slice: Number of screen lines to process in single xBRZ scaler taskset task, affects xBRZ performance, 16 is the default
# xbrz fixed scale factor: To use fixed xBRZ scale factor (i.e. to attune performance), set it to 2-6, 0 - use automatic calculation (default)
#   xbrz max scale factor: To cap maximum xBRZ scale factor used (i.e. to attune performance), set it to 2-6, 0 - use scaler allowed maximum (default)
#                 autofit: Best fits image to window
#                            - Intended for output=direct3d, fullresolution=original, aspect=true

#                                                     Some early DOS games/demos that support Sound Blaster expect the IRQ to fire but make

#                                                     setting this option.
#                                                     Option is needed for:
#                                                        Public NMI "jump" demo (1992)
#                                   enable speaker: Start the DOS virtual machine with the Sound Blaster speaker enabled.
#                                                     Sound Blaster Pro and older cards have a speaker disable/enable command.
#                                                     Normally the card boots up with the speaker disabled. If a DOS game or demo
#                                                     attempts to play without enabling the speaker, set this option to true to
#                                                     compensate. This setting has no meaning if emulating a Sound Blaster 16 card.
#                                       enable asp: If set, emulate the presence of the Sound Blaster 16 Advanced Sound Processor/Creative Sound Processor chip.
#                                                     NOTE: This only emulates it's presence and the basic DSP commands to communicate with it. Actual ASP/CSP functions are not yet implemented.
#                                disable filtering: By default DOSBox-X filters Sound Blaster output to emulate lowpass filters and analog output limitations.
#                                                     Set this option to true to disable filtering. Note that doing so disables emulation of the Sound Blaster Pro

#                                                     Set this option for some early DOS demos that make that assumption about port 22Ch.

#                                          oplmode: Type of OPL emulation. On 'auto' the mode is determined by the 'sbtype' setting.
#                                                     All OPL modes are AdLib-compatible, except for 'cms' (set 'sbtype=none' with 'cms' for a Game Blaster).
#                                                     Possible values: auto, cms, opl2, dualopl2, opl3, opl3gold, none, hardware, hardwaregb.
#             adlib force timer overflow on detect: If set, Adlib/OPL emulation will signal 'overflow' on timers after 50 I/O reads.
#                                                     This is a temporary hack to work around timing bugs noted in DOSBox-X. Certain
#                                                     games (Wolfenstein 3D) poll the Adlib status port a fixed number of times assuming
#                                                     that the poll loop takes long enough for the Adlib timer to run out. If the game
#                                                     cannot reliably detect Adlib at higher cycles counts, but can reliably detect at
#                                                     lower cycles counts, set this option.
#                                                     NOTE: Technically this decreases emulation accuracy, however it also reflects the
#                                                           fact that DOSBox-X's I/O timing code needs some work to better match the
#                                                           slowness of the ISA bus per I/O read in consideration of DOS games. So this

#                                                     'nuked' is the most accurate (but the most CPU-intensive). See oplrate as well.

#                              force dsp auto-init: Treat all single-cycle DSP commands as auto-init to keep playback going.
#                                                     This option is a workaround for DOS games or demos that use single-cycle DSP playback commands and
#                                                     have problems with missing the Sound Blaster IRQ under load. Do not enable unless you need this workaround.
#                                                     Needed for:
#                                                       - Extreme "lunatic" demo (1993)
#                                   force goldplay: Always render Sound Blaster output sample-at-a-time. Testing option. You probably don't want to enable this.
#                                         goldplay: Enable goldplay emulation.
#                                  goldplay stereo: Enable workaround for goldplay stereo playback. Many DOS demos using this technique
#                                                     don't seem to know they need to double the frequency when programming the DSP time constant for Pro stereo output.
#                                                     If stereo playback seems to have artifacts consider enabling this option. For accurate emulation of Sound Blaster

#                dsp require interrupt acknowledge: If set, the DSP will halt DMA playback until IRQ acknowledgement occurs even in auto-init mode (SB16 behavior).
#                                                     If clear, IRQ acknowledgement will have no effect on auto-init playback (SB Pro and earlier & clone behavior)
#                                                     If set to 'auto' then behavior is determined by sbtype= setting.
#                                                     This is a setting for hardware accuracy in emulation. If audio briefly plays then stops then your DOS game

#                             dsp write busy delay: Amount of time in nanoseconds the DSP chip signals 'busy' after writing to the DSP (port 2xCh). Set to -1 to use card-specific defaults.
#                                                     WARNING: Setting the value too high (above 20000ns) may have detrimental effects to DOS games that use IRQ 0 and DSP command 0x10 to play audio.
#                                                              Setting the value way too high (above 1000000ns) can cause significant lag in DOS games.

#                                                     If clear, sb16 emulation will honor the sbpro stereo bit. Note that Creative SB16 cards do not
#                                                     honor the stereo bit, and this option allows DOSBox-X emulate that fact. Accuracy setting.

#                            dsp busy cycle always: If set, the DSP busy cycle always happens. If clear, DSP busy cycle only happens when
#                                                     audio playback is running. Default setting is to pick according to the sound card.
#                              dsp busy cycle duty: If emulating SB16 busy cycle, this value (0 to 100) controls the duty cycle of the busy cycle.
#                                                     If this option is set to -1, Sound Blaster emulation will choose a value automatically according
#                                                     to sbtype=. If 0, busy cycle emulation is disabled.
#                                 io port aliasing: If set, Sound Blaster ports alias by not decoding the LSB of the I/O port.
#                                                     This option only applies when sbtype is set to sb1 or sb2 (not SBPro or SB16).

#                                       If not set, then loud music will clip to full volume just as it would on real hardware.
#                                       Enable this option for loud music if you want a more pleasing rendition without saturation and distortion.
#                         unmask dma: Start the DOS virtual machine with the DMA channel already unmasked at the controller.
#                                       Use this for DOS applications that expect to operate the GUS but forget to unmask the DMA channel.
#  ignore channel count while active: Ignore writes to the active channel count register when the DAC is enabled (bit 1 of GUS reset)
#                                       This is a HACK for demoscene prod 'Ice Fever' without which the music sounds wrong.
#                                       According to current testing real hardware does not behave this way.
#                     pic unmask irq: Start the DOS virtual machine with the GUS IRQ already unmasked at the PIC.
#                startup initialized: If set, start the GF1 in a fully initialized state (as if ULTRINIT had been run).
#                                       If clear, leave the card in an uninitialized state (as if cold boot).
#                                       Some DOS games or demoscene productions will hang or fail to use the Ultrasound hardware
#                                       because they assume the card is initialized and their hardware detect does not fully initialize the card.
#  dma enable on dma control polling: If set, automatically enable GUS DMA transfer bit in specific cases when the DMA control register is being polled.
#                                       THIS IS A HACK. Some games and demoscene productions need this hack to avoid hanging while uploading sample data
#                                       to the Gravis Ultrasound due to bugs in their implementation.
# clear dma tc irq if excess polling: If the DOS application is seen polling the IRQ status register rapidly, automatically clear the DMA TC IRQ status.
#                                       This is a hack that should only be used with DOS applications that need it to avoid bugs in their GUS support code.
#                                       Needed for:
#                                         Warcraft II by Blizzard ............. if using GUS for music and sound, set this option to prevent the game from
#                                                                               hanging when you click on the buttons in the main menu.
#            force master irq enable: Set this option if a DOS game or demo initializes the GUS but is unable to play any music.
#                                       Usually the cause is buggy GUS support that resets the GUS but fails to set the Master IRQ enable bit.
#                  gus panning table: Controls which table or equation is used for the Gravis Ultrasound panning emulation.
#                                       accurate emulation attempts to better reflect how the actual hardware handles panning,
#                                       while the old emulation uses a simpler idealistic mapping.
#                                       Possible values: old, accurate, default.
#                            gusrate: Sample rate of Ultrasound emulation.

#              gus fixed render rate: If set, Gravis Ultrasound audio output is rendered at a fixed sample rate specified by 'gusrate'. This can provide better quality than real hardware,
#                                       if desired. Else, Gravis Ultrasound emulation will change the sample rate of it's output according to the number of active channels, just like real hardware.
#                                       Note: DOSBox-X defaults to 'false', while mainline DOSBox SVN is currently hardcoded to render as if this setting is 'true'.

#                                      xms handles: Number of XMS handles available for the DOS environment, or 0 to use a reasonable default
#                  shell configuration as commands: Allow entering dosbox-x.conf configuration parameters as shell commands to get and set settings.
#                                                     This is disabled by default to avoid conflicts between commands and executables.
#                                                     It is recommended to get and set dosbox-x.conf settings using the CONFIG command instead.
#                                                     Compatibility with DOSBox SVN can be improved by enabling this option.
#                                              hma: Report through XMS that HMA exists (not necessarily available)
#                            hma allow reservation: Allow TSR and application (anything other than the DOS kernel) to request control of the HMA.
#                                                     They will not be able to request control however if the DOS kernel is configured to occupy the HMA (DOS=HIGH)
#                       hard drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) hard disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                                     Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 to use a reasonable default.
#                                drive z is remote: If set, DOS will report drive Z as remote. If not set, DOS will report drive Z as local.
#                                                     If auto (default), DOS will report drive Z as remote or local depending on the program.
#                                                     Set this option to true to prevent SCANDISK.EXE from attempting scan and repair drive Z:
#                                                     which is impossible since Z: is a virtual drive not backed by a disk filesystem.
#                                                     Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                           hma minimum allocation: Minimum allocation size for HMA in bytes (equivalent to /HMAMIN= parameter).
#                                         ansi.sys: If set (by default), ANSI.SYS emulation is on. If clear, ANSI.SYS is not emulated and will not appear to be installed.
#                                                     NOTE: This option has no effect in PC-98 mode where MS-DOS systems integrate ANSI.SYS into the DOS kernel.
#                                      log console: If set, log DOS CON output to the log file.
#                                     dos sda size: SDA (swappable data area) size, in bytes. Set to 0 to use a reasonable default.
#                                   hma free space: Controls the amount of free space available in HMA. This setting is not meaningful unless the
#                                                     DOS kernel occupies HMA and the emulated DOS version is at least 5.0.
#                           cpm compatibility mode: This controls how the DOS kernel sets up the CP/M compatibility code in the PSP segment.
#                                                     Several options are provided to emulate one of several undocumented behaviors related to the CP/M entry point.
#                                                     If set to auto, DOSBox-X will pick the best option to allow it to work properly.
#                                                     Unless set to 'off', this option will require the DOS kernel to occupy the first 256 bytes of the HMA memory area
#                                                     to prevent crashes when the A20 gate is switched on.
#                                                        auto      Pick the best option
#                                                        off       Turn off the CP/M entry point (program will abort if called)
#                                                        msdos2    MS-DOS 2.x behavior, offset field also doubles as data segment size
#                                                        msdos5    MS-DOS 5.x behavior, entry point becomes one of two fixed addresses
#                                                        direct    Non-standard behavior, encode the CALL FAR directly to the entry point rather than indirectly
#                                                     Possible values: auto, off, msdos2, msdos5, direct.
#                                            share: Report SHARE.EXE as resident. Does not actually emulate SHARE functions.
#              minimum dos initial private segment: In non-mainline mapping mode, where DOS structures are allocated from base memory, this sets the
#                                                     minimum segment value. Recommended value is 0x70. You may reduce the value down to 0x50 if freeing
#                                                     up more memory is important. Set to 0 for default.
#                              minimum mcb segment: Minimum segment value to begin memory allocation from, in hexadecimal. Set to 0 for default.
#                                                     You can increase available DOS memory by reducing this value down to as low as 0x51, however
#                                                     setting it to low can cause some DOS programs to crash or run erratically, and some DOS games
#                                                     and demos to cause intermittent static noises when using Sound Blaster output. DOS programs
#                                                     compressed with Microsoft EXEPACK will not run if the minimum MCB segment is below 64KB.
#                                 minimum mcb free: Minimum free segment value to leave free. At startup, the DOS kernel will allocate memory
#                                                     up to this point. This can be used to deal with EXEPACK issues or DOS programs that cannot
#                                                     be loaded too low in memory. This differs from 'minimum mcb segment' in that this affects
#                                                     the lowest free block instead of the starting point of the mcb chain.
#                          enable dummy device mcb: If set (default), allocate a fake device MCB at the base of conventional memory.
#                                                     Clearing this option can reclaim a small amount of conventional memory at the expense of
#                                                     some minor DOS compatibility.
#           maximum environment block size on exec: Maximum environment block size to copy for child processes. Set to -1 for default.
#        additional environment block size on exec: When executing a program, compute the size of the parent block then add this amount to allow for a few additional variables.
#                                                     If the subprocesses will never add/modify the environment block, you can free up a few additional bytes by setting this to 0.
#                                                     Set to -1 for default setting.
#                       enable a20 on windows init: If set, DOSBox-X will enable the A20 gate when Windows 3.1/9x broadcasts the INIT message
#                                                     at startup. Windows 3.1 appears to make assumptions at some key points on startup about
#                                                     A20 that don't quite hold up and cause Windows 3.1 to crash when you set A20 emulation
#                                                     to a20=mask as opposed to a20=fast. This option is enabled by default.
#             zero memory on xms memory allocation: If set, memory returned by XMS allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                     DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
#                                                     related to uninitialized variables in extended memory. When enabled this option may
#                                                     incur a slight to moderate performance penalty.
#                                             dosv: Enable DOS/V emulation and specify which version to emulate. This option is intended for
#                                                     use with games or software originating from Asia that use the double byte character set
#                                                     encodings and the DOS/V extensions to display Japanese, Chinese, or Korean text.
#                                                     Note that enabling DOS/V replaces 80x25 text mode (INT 10h mode 3) with a EGA/VGA graphics
#                                                     mode that emulates text mode to display the characters and may be incompatible with non-Asian
#                                                     software that assumes direct access to the text mode via segment 0xB800.
#                                                     WARNING: This option is very experimental at this time.
#                                                     Possible values: off, japanese, chinese, korean.
#                                              ems: Enable EMS support. The default (=true) provides the best
#                                                     compatibility but certain applications may run better with
#                                                     other choices, or require EMS support to be disabled (=false)
#                                                     to work at all.
#                                                     Possible values: true, emsboard, emm386, false.
#                                             vcpi: If set and expanded memory is enabled, also emulate VCPI.
#                          unmask timer on disk io: If set, INT 21h emulation will unmask IRQ 0 (timer interrupt) when the application opens/closes/reads/writes files.
#                           zero int 67h if no ems: If ems=false, leave interrupt vector 67h zeroed out (default true).
#                                                     This is a workaround for games or demos that try to detect EMS by whether or not INT 67h is 0000:0000 rather than a proper test.
#                                                     This option also affects whether INT 67h is zeroed when booting a guest OS
#                              zero unused int 68h: Leave INT 68h zero at startup.
#                                                     Set this to true for certain games that use INT 68h in unusual ways that require a zero value.
#                                                     Note that the vector is left at zero anyway when machine=cga.
#                                                     This is needed to properly run 1988 game 'PopCorn'.
#                            emm386 startup active: If set and expanded memory is set to emulate emm386, start the DOS machine with EMM386.EXE active
#                                                     (running the 16-bit DOS environment from within Virtual 8086 mode). If you will be running anything
#                                                     that involves a DOS extender you will also need to enable the VCPI interface as well.
#             zero memory on ems memory allocation: If set, memory returned by EMS allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                     DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
#                                                     related to uninitialized variables in expanded memory. When enabled this option may
#                                                     incur a slight to moderate performance penalty.
#                    ems system handle memory size: Amount of memory associated with system handle, in KB
#               ems system handle on even megabyte: If set, try to allocate the EMM system handle on an even megabyte.
#                                                     If the DOS game or demo fiddles with the A20 gate while using EMM386.EXE emulation in virtual 8086 mode, setting this option may help prevent crashes.
#                                                     However, forcing allocation on an even megabyte will also cause some extended memory fragmentation and reduce the
#                                                     overall amount of extended memory available to the DOS game depending on whether it expects large contiguous chunks
#                                                     of extended memory.
#                                              umb: Enable UMB support.
#                                        umb start: UMB region starting segment
#                                          umb end: UMB region last segment
#                         kernel allocation in umb: If set, dynamic kernel allocation=1, and private area in umb=1, all kernel structures will be allocated from the private area in UMB.

#         zero memory on int 21h memory allocation: If set, memory returned by the INT 21h allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                     DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
