# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 2025.05.03. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.
# To write out ALL options, use command 'config -all' with -wc or -writeconf options.

[sdl]
#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#    windowposition: Set the window position at startup in the positionX,positionY format (e.g.: 1300,200).
#                      The window will be centered with "," (or empty), and will be in the original position with "-".
#           display: Specify a screen/display number to use for a multi-screen setup (0 = default).
#            output: What video system to use for output (surface = software (SDL_Surface); openglnb = OpenGL nearest; openglpp = OpenGL perfect; ttf = TrueType font output).
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, ttf, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, ddraw, direct3d.
#       videodriver: Forces a video driver (e.g. windib/windows, directx, x11, fbcon, dummy, etc) for the SDL library to use.
#      transparency: Set the transparency of the DOSBox-X screen (both windowed and full-screen modes, on SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds).
#                      The valid value is from 0 (no transparency, the default setting) to 90 (high transparency).
#          maximize: If set, the DOSBox-X window will be maximized at start (SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds only; use fullscreen for TTF output).
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
# autolock_feedback: Autolock status feedback type, i.e. visual, auditive, none.
#                      Possible values: none, beep, flash.
#     middle_unlock: Whether you can press the middle mouse button to unlock the mouse when the mouse has been locked.
#                      If set to "manual", it works only with "autolock=false"; if set to "auto", it works only with "autolock=true".
#                      Possible values: none, manual, auto, both.
# clip_mouse_button: Select the mouse button or use arrow keys for the shared clipboard copy/paste function.
#                      The default mouse button is "right", which means using the right mouse button to select text, copy to and paste from the host clipboard.
#                      Set to "middle" to use the middle mouse button, "arrows" to use arrow keys instead of a mouse button, or "none" to disable this feature.
#                      For "arrows", press Home key (or Fn+Shift+Left on Mac laptops) to start selection, and End key (or Fn+Shift+Right on Mac laptops) to end selection.
#                      Possible values: none, middle, right, arrows.
# clip_key_modifier: Change the keyboard modifier for the shared clipboard copy/paste function using a mouse button or arrow keys.
#                      The default modifier is "shift" (both left and right shift keys). Set to "none" if no modifier is desired.
#                      Possible values: none, ctrl, lctrl, rctrl, alt, lalt, ralt, shift, lshift, rshift, ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, lctrlalt, lctrlshift, laltshift, rctrlalt, rctrlshift, raltshift.
#   clip_paste_bios: Specify whether to use BIOS keyboard functions for the clipboard pasting instead of the keystroke method.
#                      For pasting clipboard text into Windows 3.x/9x applications (e.g. Notepad), make sure to use the keystroke method.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, default.
#  clip_paste_speed: Set keyboard speed for pasting text from the shared clipboard.
#                      If the default setting of 30 causes lost keystrokes, increase the number.
#                      Or experiment with decreasing the number for applications that accept keystrokes quickly.
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#   usesystemcursor: Use the mouse cursor of the host system instead of drawing a DOS mouse cursor. Activated when the mouse is not locked.
#   mouse_emulation: When is mouse emulated ?
#                      integration: when not locked
#                      locked:      when locked
#                      always:      every time
#                      never:       at no time
#                      If disabled, the mouse position in DOSBox-X is exactly where the host OS reports it.
#                      When using a high DPI mouse, the emulation of mouse movement can noticeably reduce the
#                      sensitiveness of your device, i.e. the mouse is slower but more precise.
#                      Possible values: integration, locked, always, never.
#   mouse_wheel_key: Convert mouse wheel movements into keyboard presses such as arrow keys.
#                      0: disabled; 1: up/down arrows; 2: left/right arrows; 3: PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      4: Ctrl+up/down arrows; 5: Ctrl+left/right arrows; 6: Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      7: Ctrl+W/Z, as supported by text editors like WordStar and MS-DOS EDIT.
#                      Putting a minus sign in front will disable the conversion for guest systems.
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, in favor of scancodes. Might not work on all operating systems.
#                      If set to "auto" (default), it is enabled when using non-US keyboards in SDL1 builds.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          overscan: Width of the overscan border (0 to 10) for the "surface" output.
#          titlebar: Change the string displayed in the DOSBox-X title bar.
#         showbasic: If set, DOSBox-X will show basic information including the DOSBox-X version number and current running speed in the title bar.
#       showdetails: If set, DOSBox-X will show the cycles count (FPS) and emulation speed relative to realtime in the title bar.
#          showmenu: Whether to show the menu bar (if supported). Default true.

#                              This is the path of the base file name. For example logo=subdir\sets\007\logo
#                              with machine=vgaonly will use subdir\sets\007\logo224x224.png as the logo.
#              fastbioslogo: If set, DOSBox-X will skip the BIOS screen by activating fast BIOS logo mode (without 1-second pause).
#               startbanner: If set (default), DOSBox-X will display the welcome banner when it starts.
#          bannercolortheme: You can specify a different background color theme for the welcome banner from the default one.

#  configuration tool theme: Theme for the configuration tool.
#                              If not set, host dark mode setting will be followed.
#                              
#                              Possible values: Windows Default, Arizona, Black Leather Jacket, Bordeaux, Cinnamon, Designer, Emerald City, Fluorescent, HotDog Stand, LCD Default Screen Settings, LCD Reversed - Dark, LCD Reversed - Light, Mahogany, Monochrome, Ocean, Pastel, Patchwork, Plasma Power Saver, Rugby, The Blues, Tweed, Valentine, Wingtips.
#                 dpi aware: Set this option (auto by default) to indicate to your OS that DOSBox-X is DPI aware.
#                              If it is not set, Windows Vista/7/8/10 and higher may upscale the DOSBox-X window
#                              on higher resolution monitors which is probably not what you want.
#                              Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#              quit warning: Set this option to indicate whether DOSBox-X should show a warning message when the user tries to close its window.
#                              If set to auto (default), DOSBox-X will warn if a DOS program, game or a guest system is currently running.
#                              If set to autofile, DOSBox-X will warn if there are open file handles or a guest system is currently running.
#                              Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto, autofile.
#  working directory option: Select an option for DOSBox-X's working directory when it runs.
#                              autoprompt: DOSBox-X will auto-decide whether to prompt for a working directory.
#                              config: DOSBox-X will use the primary config file directory as the working directory.
#                              custom: Specify a working directory via the "working directory default" option.
#                              default: Similar to autoprompt, but DOSBox-X will ask whether to save the selected folder.
#                              force: Similar to "custom", while overriding -defaultdir command-line option if used.
#                              noprompt: DOSBox-X uses the current directory and never prompts for a working directory.
#                              program: DOSBox-X will use the DOSBox-X program directory as the working directory.
#                              prompt: DOSBox-X will always ask the user to select a working directory when it runs.
#                              userconfig: DOSBox-X will use its user configuration directory as the working directory.
#                              Possible values: autoprompt, config, custom, default, force, noprompt, program, prompt, userconfig.
# working directory default: The default directory to act as DOSBox-X's working directory. See also the setting "working directory option".
#                              For working directory option=prompt, the specified directory becomes the default directory for the folder selection.
#     show advanced options: If set, the Configuration Tool will display all config options (including advanced ones) by default.
#       resolve config path: If set to true, DOSBox-X will resolve options containing paths in the config file (except [autoexec] section).
#                              This includes environment variables (%VAR% [DOS/Windows] or ${VAR} [Linux/macOS] and tilde (~) in Linux/macOS.
#                              If set to dosvar, DOSBox-X forces to resolve DOS-style environment variables (%VAR%) in all platforms (and tilde).
#                              If set to tilde, DOSBox-X will only resolve tilde (~) in Linux/macOS but will not resolve environment variables.
#                              Possible values: true, false, dosvar, tilde, 1, 0.
#                   hostkey: By default, DOSBox-X uses the mapper-defined host key, which defaults to F11 on Windows and F12 on other platforms.
#                              You may alternatively specify a host key with this setting and bypass the host key as defined in the mapper.
#                              This can also be done from the menu ("Main" => "Select host key").
#                              Possible values: ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, mapper.
#           mapper send key: Select the key the mapper SendKey function will send.
#                              Possible values: winlogo, winmenu, alttab, ctrlesc, ctrlbreak, ctrlaltdel.
#                       ime: Enables support for the system input methods (IME) for inputting characters in Windows and Linux builds.
#                              If set to auto, this feature is only enabled if DOSBox-X starts with a Chinese/Japanese/Korean code page.
#                              Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          synchronize time: If set, DOSBox-X will try to automatically synchronize time with the host, unless you decide to change the date/time manually.
#                   machine: The type of machine DOSBox-X tries to emulate.
#                              Possible values: mda, cga, cga_mono, cga_rgb, cga_composite, cga_composite2, hercules, hercules_plus, hercules_incolor, hercules_color, tandy, pcjr, pcjr_composite, pcjr_composite2, amstrad, ega, ega200, jega, mcga, vgaonly, svga_s3, svga_s386c928, svga_s3vision864, svga_s3vision868, svga_s3vision964, svga_s3vision968, svga_s3trio32, svga_s3trio64, svga_s3trio64v+, svga_s3virge, svga_s3virgevx, svga_et3000, svga_et4000, svga_paradise, vesa_nolfb, vesa_oldvbe, vesa_oldvbe10, pc98, pc9801, pc9821, svga_ati_egavgawonder, svga_ati_vgawonder, svga_ati_vgawonderplus, svga_ati_vgawonderxl, svga_ati_vgawonderxl24, svga_ati_mach8, svga_ati_mach32, svga_ati_mach64, fm_towns.
#                  captures: Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
#                  autosave: Enable the auto-save state feature. Specify a time interval in seconds, and optionally a save slot or start and end save slots.
#                              For example, "autosave=10 11-20" will set a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the save slots used will be between 11 and 20.
#                              You can additionally specify up to 9 programs for this feature, e.g. "autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35" for "EDIT" and "EDITOR".
#                              Putting a minus sign (-) before the time interval causes the auto-saving function to not be activated at start.
#                  saveslot: Select the default save slot (1-100) to save/load states.
#                  savefile: Select the default save file to save/load states. If specified it will be used instead of the save slot.
#                saveremark: If set, the save state feature will ask users to enter remarks when saving a state.
#            forceloadstate: If set, DOSBox-X will load a saved state even if it finds there is a mismatch in the DOSBox-X version, machine type, program name and/or the memory size.
#                       a20: A20 gate emulation mode.
#                              The on/off/on_fake/off_fake options are intended for testing and debugging DOS development,
#                              or to emulate obscure hardware, or to work around potential extended memory problems with DOS programs.
#                              on_fake/off_fake are intended to test whether a program carries out a memory test to ensure the A20
#                              gate is set as intended (as HIMEM.SYS does). If it goes by the gate bit alone, it WILL crash.
#                              This parameter is also changeable from the builtin A20GATE command.
#                                fast                         Emulate A20 gating by remapping the first 64KB @ 1MB boundary (fast, mainline DOSBox behavior)
#                                mask                         Emulate A20 gating by masking memory I/O address (accurate)
#                                off                          Lock A20 gate off (Software/OS cannot enable A20)
#                                on                           Lock A20 gate on (Software/OS cannot disable A20)
#                                off_fake                     Lock A20 gate off but allow bit to toggle (hope your DOS game tests the HMA!)
#                                on_fake                      Lock A20 gate on but allow bit to toggle
#               memory file: If set, guest memory is memory-mapped from a file on disk, rather than allocated from memory.
#                              This option can help keep DOSBox-X from consuming too much RAM for large values of memsize.
#                              This option is required to emulate 4GB or more of RAM. The file will be created if it does not exist
#                              and it does not require any special maintenance or formatting.
#                   memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox-X has in megabytes.
#                              This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#                              although other games and applications may require a higher value.
#                              Programs that use 286 protected mode like Windows 3.0 in Standard Mode may crash with more than 15MB.
#                              A memory file is required to emulate a memory size of 4GB or more.
#                              The maximum value allowed is affected by the memalias setting which affects the maximum amount of memory CPU can access as a power of 2.
#                              The maximum value is also affected by the CPU type. See DOSBox-X console and log file for details.

#      frameskip: How many frames DOSBox-X skips before drawing one.
#         aspect: Aspect ratio correction mode. Can be set to the following values:
#                     'false' (default):
#                         'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full
#                            window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in dis-
#                            proportional image
#                         'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction,
#                            resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel
#                            ratio is not 4:3 (default)
#                     'true':
#                         'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to
#                            scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output 
#                            to proportional 4:3 image
#                            In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable
#                           (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image
#                            is upscaled).
#                            Should have none to negligible impact on performance,
#                            mostly being done in hardware.
#                            For the pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is
#                            recommended to enable this whenever the emulated display
#                            has an aspect ratio of 4:3
#                         'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction
#                            method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct
#                            output to 4:3 ratio)
#                            Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix
#                            well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x
#                            will work poorly
#                            Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact
#                            on performance.
#                            When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect
#                            ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of
#                            the above apply.
#                   Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#   aspect_ratio: Set the aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9) in the aspect ratio correction mode. 0:0 means the default ratio of 4:3, and -1:-1 means the original image ratio.
#          char9: Allow 9-pixel wide text mode fonts instead of 8-pixel wide fonts.
#           euro: Display Euro symbol instead of the specified ASCII character (33-255).
#                   For example, setting it to 128 allows Euro symbol to be displayed instead of C-cedilla.
#     doublescan: If set, doublescanned output emits two scanlines for each source line, in the same manner as the actual VGA output (320x200 is rendered as 640x400 for example).
#                   If clear, doublescanned output is rendered at the native source resolution (320x200 as 320x200).
#                   This affects the raster PRIOR to the software or hardware scalers.
#                   Setting this option may prevent some scalers to work as expected.
#                   Try turning this option off in such case.
#                   For pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to turn this option off.
#         scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. Add keyword 'forced', after the name of the scaler to always use the scaler even if the result might not be desired.(e.g. 'normal2x forced')
#                   Appending 'prompt' will cause a confirmation message for forcing the scaler.
#                   To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                   To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                   Scalers should work with most output options, but they are ignored for openglpp and TrueType font outputs.
#                   If you are using OpenGL/Direct3D output and a shader that requires it, set to hardware_none or hardware2x.
#                   Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.
#       glshader: Path to GLSL shader source to use with OpenGL output ("none" to disable, or "default" for default shader).
#                   Can be either an absolute path, a file in the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X configuration directory, or one of the built-in shaders (e.g. "sharp" for the pixel-perfect scaling mode):
#                   advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp.
#    pixelshader: Set Direct3D pixel shader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory). If 'forced' is appended, then the pixel shader will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#        autofit: Best fits image to window
#                     Intended for output=direct3d, fullresolution=original, aspect=true
# monochrome_pal: Specify the color of monochrome display.
#                   Append 'bright' for a brighter look.
#                   Possible values: green, amber, gray, white.

[cpu]
#               core: CPU Core used in emulation. auto will switch to dynamic if available and appropriate.
#                       For the dynamic core, both dynamic_x86 and dynamic_rec are supported (dynamic_x86 is preferred).
#                       Windows 95 or other preemptive multitasking OSes will not work with the dynamic_rec core.

#     segment limits: Enforce checks for segment limits on 80286 and higher CPU types.
#     lds wraparound: For LDS/LES instructions, in 16-bit code, check for 64KB wraparound case.
#            cputype: CPU Type used in emulation. "auto" emulates a 486 which tolerates Pentium instructions.
#                       "experimental" enables newer instructions not normally found in the CPU types emulated by DOSBox-X, such as FISTTP.
#                       Possible values: auto, 8086, 8086_prefetch, 80186, 80186_prefetch, 286, 286_prefetch, 386, 386_prefetch, 486old, 486old_prefetch, 486, 486_prefetch, pentium, pentium_mmx, ppro_slow, pentium_ii, pentium_iii, experimental.
#             cycles: Number of instructions DOSBox-X tries to emulate each millisecond.
#                       Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#                       Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#                         'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                                         It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#                         'fixed #number' will set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
#                                         need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#                         'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                                         handle. Recommended if better performance is desired.
#                       Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#            cycleup: Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with the mapped keyboard shortcut.
#          cycledown: Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
#              turbo: Enables Turbo (Fast Forward) mode to speed up operations.
#            apmbios: Emulate Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS calls.
# integration device: Enable DOSBox-X's integration I/O device, a way for additional software to talk to DOSBox-X. It is currently experimental.
#                       This can for example be used to return DOSBox-X's current status and by the guest OS to match the mouse pointer position.
#         isapnpbios: Emulate ISA Plug & Play BIOS. Enable if using DOSBox-X to run a PnP aware DOS program or if booting Windows 9x.
#                       Do not disable if Windows 9x is configured around PnP devices, you will likely confuse it.

[ttf]
#         font: Specifies a TrueType font to use for the TTF output. If not specified, the built-in TrueType font will be used.
#                 Either a font name or full font path can be specified. If file ends with the .TTF extension then the extension can be omitted.
#                 For a font name or relative path, directories such as the working directory and default system font directory will be searched.
#                 For example, setting it to "consola" or "consola.ttf" will use Consola font (included in Windows); similar for other TTF fonts.
#                 Additionally, OTF fonts (e.g. OratorStd.otf), .FON fonts (e.g. vgasys.fon), and .TTC fonts (e.g. msgothic.ttc) are also supported.
#                 To display Chinese/Japanese/Korean text in these code pages, a font with CJK characters is needed (e.g. GNU Unifont or Sarasa Gothic).
#     fontbold: You can optionally specify a bold TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the bold text style.
#                 It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual bold font will be used for the bold style.
#                 For example, setting it to "consolab" or "consolab.ttf" will use the Consolab font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#     fontital: You can optionally specify an italic TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the italic text style.
#                 It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual italic font will be used for the italic style.
#                 For example, setting it to "consolai" or "consolai.ttf" will use the Consolai font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#     fontboit: You can optionally specify a bold italic TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the bold italic text style.
#                 It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual bold-italic font will be used for the bold-italic style.
#                 For example, setting it to "consolaz" or "consolaz.ttf" will use the Consolaz font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#       colors: Specifies a color scheme to use for the TTF output by supply all 16 color values in RGB: (r,g,b) or hexadecimal as in HTML: #RRGGBB
#                 The original DOS colors (0-15): #000000 #0000aa #00aa00 #00aaaa #aa0000 #aa00aa #aa5500 #aaaaaa #555555 #5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 #ffffff
#                 gray scaled color scheme: (0,0,0)  #0e0e0e  (75,75,75) (89,89,89) (38,38,38) (52,52,52) #717171 #c0c0c0 #808080 (28,28,28) (150,150,150) (178,178,178) (76,76,76) (104,104,104) (226,226,226) (255,255,255)
#                 An optional leading "+" sign allows the preset color scheme to be used when switching from another output.
# outputswitch: Specifies the output that DOSBox-X should switch to from the TTF output when a graphical mode is requested, or auto for automatic selection.
#                 Possible values: auto, surface, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, direct3d.
#      winperc: Specifies the window percentage for the TTF output (100 = full screen). Ignored if the ptsize setting is specified.
#       ptsize: Specifies the font point size for the TTF output. If specified (minimum: 9), it will override the winperc setting.
#         lins: Specifies the number of rows on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#         cols: Specifies the number of columns on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#  righttoleft: If set, DOSBox-X will display text from right to left instead of left to right on the screen for the TTF output.
#                 This is especially useful for languages which use right-to-left scripts (such as Arabic and Hebrew).
#           wp: You can specify a word processor for the TTF output and optionally also a version number for the word processor.
#                 Supported word processors are WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite, FE=FastEdit, and an optional version number.
#                 For example, WP6 will set the word processor as WordPerfect 6, and XY4 will set the word processor as XyWrite 4.
#                 Word processor-specific features like on-screen text styles and 512-character font will be enabled based on this.
#         bold: If set, DOSBox-X will display bold text in visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#                 This is done either with the actual bold font specified by the fontbold option, or by making it bold automatically.
#       italic: If set, DOSBox-X will display italicized text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#                 This is done either with the actual italic font specified by the fontital option, or by slanting the characters automatically.
#    underline: If set, DOSBox-X will display underlined text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#    strikeout: If set, DOSBox-X will display strikeout text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#    printfont: If set, DOSBox-X will force to use the current TrueType font (set via font option) for printing in addition to displaying.
#     autodbcs: If set, DOSBox-X enables Chinese/Japanese/Korean DBCS (double-byte) characters when these code pages are active by default.
#                 Only applicable when using a DBCS code page (932: Japanese, 936: Simplified Chinese; 949: Korean; 950: Traditional Chinese)
#                 This applies to both the display and printing of these characters (see the [printer] section for details of the latter).
#       blinkc: If set to true, the cursor blinks for the TTF output; setting it to false will turn the blinking off.
#                 You can also change the blinking rate by setting an integer between 1 (fastest) and 7 (slowest), or 0 for no cursor.
#          gbk: Enables the GBK extension (in addition to the standard GB2312 charset) for the Simplified Chinese TTF output or DOS/V emulation.
#     chinasea: Enables the ChinaSea and Big5-2003 extension (in addition to the standard Big5-1984 charset) for the Traditional Chinese TTF output.
#                 A TTF/OTF font containing such characters (such as the included SarasaGothicFixed TTF font) is needed to correctly render ChinaSea characters.
#     dosvfunc: If set, enables FEP control to function for Japanese DOS/V applications, and changes the blinking of character attributes to high brightness.
#

# shell configuration as commands: Allow entering dosbox-x.conf configuration parameters as shell commands to get and set settings.
#                                    This is disabled by default to avoid conflicts between commands and executables.
#                                    It is recommended to get and set dosbox-x.conf settings using the CONFIG command instead.
#                                    Compatibility with DOSBox SVN can be improved by enabling this option.
#                             hma: Report through XMS that HMA exists (not necessarily available)
#      hard drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) hard disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                    Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 (default) to use a reasonable limit.
#                                    The disk I/O performance as in DOSBox SVN can be achieved by setting this to 0.
#    floppy drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) floppy disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                    Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 (default) to use a reasonable limit.
#                                    The disk I/O performance as in DOSBox SVN can be achieved by setting this to 0.
#                        ansi.sys: If set (by default), ANSI.SYS emulation is on. If clear, ANSI.SYS is not emulated and will not appear to be installed.
#                                    NOTE: This option has no effect in PC-98 mode where MS-DOS systems integrate ANSI.SYS into the DOS kernel.
#                     log console: If set, log DOS CON output to the log file. Setting to "quiet" will log DOS CON output only (no debugging output).

#                           share: Reports SHARE.EXE as resident and provides functions such as file-locking and record-locking, although not all SHARE functions are emulated.
#               file access tries: If a positive integer is set, DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock files directly on mounted local drives for the specified number of times without caching before failing on Windows systems.
#                                    For networked database applications (e.g. dBase, FoxPro, etc), it is strongly recommended to set this to e.g. 3 for correct operations.
#              network redirector: Report DOS network redirector as resident. This will allow the host name to be returned unless the secure mode is enabled.
#                                    You can also directly access UNC network paths in the form \\MACHINE\SHARE even if they are not mounted as drives on Windows systems.
#                                    Set either "ipx=true" in [ipx] section or "ne2000=true" in [ne2000] section for a full network redirector environment.
#                minimum mcb free: Minimum free segment value to leave free. At startup, the DOS kernel will allocate memory
#                                    up to this point. This can be used to deal with EXEPACK issues or DOS programs that cannot
#                                    be loaded too low in memory. If you want more free conventional memory to be reported,
#                                    you can for example set its value to 1.
#                             ems: Enable EMS support. The default (=true) provides the best
#                                    compatibility but certain applications may run better with
#                                    other choices, or require EMS support to be disabled (=false)
#                                    to work at all.
#                                    Possible values: true, emsboard, emm386, false, 1, 0.
#                             umb: Enable UMB support.
#                    quick reboot: If set, the DOS restart call will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated DOS or guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine.
#

#                                    auto (or unset)                  Pick DOS kernel version 5.0 (DOSBox default)
#                                    3.3                              MS-DOS 3.3 emulation (not tested!)

#                                    Long filename (LFN) support will be enabled with a reported DOS version of 7.0 or higher with "lfn=auto" (default).
#                                    Similarly, FAT32 disk images will be supported with a reported DOS version of 7.1 or higher.
#                                    
#                             lfn: Enable long filename support. If set to auto (default), LFN support is enabled if the reported DOS version is at least 7.0.
#                                    If set to autostart, the built-in VER command won't activate/deactivate LFN support according to the reported DOS version.
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto, autostart.
#                 fat32setversion: Whether DOSBox-X should automatically set the reported DOS version to 7.0/7.10 when it is less than 7.0/7.10 and mounting LBA/FAT32 disk images is requested.
#                                    If set to "ask", a popup message will show up to ask whether DOSBox-X should automatically change the reported DOS version in order to mount the disk image.
#                                    Possible values: ask, auto, manual.
#                       shellhigh: Load the DOSBox-X command shell into the upper memory when the UMB is available.
#                                    If set to auto (default), it is enabled if the reported DOS version is at least 7.0.
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                       automount: Enable automatic drive mounting in Windows.
#                    automountall: Automatically mount all available Windows drives at start.
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, quiet.
#                    mountwarning: If set, a warning message will be displayed while trying to auto-mount your Windows host drives.
#                  autofixwarning: If set to true or both, DOSBox-X shows messages while trying to automatically fix the "Packed file is corrupt" error.
#                                    If set to false or none, DOSBox-X will not show such messages on the screen when the error occurred.
#                                    If set to "a20fix" or "loadfix", DOSBox-X will show the message for the a20fix or the loadfix only.
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, both, a20fix, loadfix, none.
#                        startcmd: Enable START command to start programs to run on the host system. On Windows host programs or commands may also be launched directly.
#                  starttranspath: Specify whether DOSBox-X should automatically translate all paths in the command-line to host system paths when starting programs to run on the host system.
#                       startwait: Specify whether DOSBox-X should wait for the host system applications after they are started.
#                      startquiet: If set, before launching host system applications to run on the host DOSBox-X will not show messages like "Now run it as a Windows application".
#                    startnopause: If set, DOSBox-X will not pause after host command execution is completed.
#                          vmware: Enable VMware interface emulation including guest mouse integration (when used along with e.g. VMware mouse driver for Windows 3.x).
#                           int33: Enable INT 33H for mouse support.
#               mouse report rate: Mouse reporting rate, or 0 for auto. This affects how often mouse events are reported to the guest through the mouse interrupt.
#                                    Some games including CyClone need a lower reporting rate to function correctly. Auto mode allows the guest to change the report rate through the PS/2 mouse emulation.
#                                    This option does not affect any DOS game that uses polling through INT 33h to detect mouse movement.
#                  keyboardlayout: Language code of the keyboard layout (or none).
#                  customcodepage: Set a custom code page for CHCP command and specify a SBCS code page file, following the standard SBCS code page format.
#                                    Examples of SBCS code pages are available from the Unicode Consortium website: https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/PC/
#                            dbcs: Enable DBCS table and Chinese, Japanese, Korean support for the TrueType font (TTF) output.
#                                    CAUTION: Some software will crash without the DBCS table, including the Open Watcom installer.
#     dos clipboard device enable: If enabled, a DOS device will be added for bidirectional communications with the shared clipboard.
#                                    Setting to "read" will only allow read access, and setting to "write" will only allow write access.
#                                    Setting to "full" or "true" enables both; setting to "false" or "disabled" disables the access or device.
#                                    The default device name is CLIP$, but can be changed with the "dos clipboard device name" setting below.
#       dos clipboard device name: Set DOS device name (up to 8 characters) for bidirectional communications with the shared clipboard.
#                                    If unset or invalid, the default name CLIP$ will be used (e.g. "TYPE CLIP$" shows the clipboard contents).
#                                    It has no effect if "dos clipboard device enable" is disabled, and it is deactivated if the secure mode is enabled.
#               dos clipboard api: If set, DOS APIs for communications with the Windows clipboard will be enabled for shared clipboard communications.
#                                    Caution: Enabling this API may cause some programs to think they are running under Windows
#                    dos idle api: If set, DOSBox-X can lower the host system's CPU load when a supported guest program is idle.
