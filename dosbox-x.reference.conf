# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 0.83.11. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.
# To write out ALL options, use command 'config -all' with -wc or -writeconf options.

[sdl]
#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#    windowposition: Set the window position at startup in the positionX,positionY format (e.g.: 1300,200)
#           display: Specify a screen/display number to use for a multi-screen setup (0 = default).
#            output: What video system to use for output (openglnb = OpenGL nearest; openglpp = OpenGL perfect; ttf = TrueType font output).
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, ddraw, ttf.
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
# clip_mouse_button: Select the mouse button or use arrow keys for the shared clipboard copy/paste function.
#                      The default mouse button is "right", which means using the right mouse button to select text, copy to and paste from the host clipboard.
#                      Set to "middle" to use the middle mouse button, "arrows" to use arrow keys instead of a mouse button, or "none" to disable this feature.
#                      Possible values: none, middle, right, arrows.
# clip_key_modifier: Change the keyboard modifier for the shared clipboard copy/paste function using a mouse button or arrow keys.
#                      The default modifier is "shift" (both left and right shift keys). Set to "none" if no modifier is desired.
#                      Possible values: none, ctrl, lctrl, rctrl, alt, lalt, ralt, shift, lshift, rshift, ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, lctrlalt, lctrlshift, laltshift, rctrlalt, rctrlshift, raltshift.
#   clip_paste_bios: Specify whether to use BIOS keyboard functions for clipboard pasting instead of the keystroke method.
#                      For pasting clipboard text into Windows 3.x/9x applications, make sure to use the keystroke method.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#  clip_paste_speed: Set keyboard speed for pasting from the shared clipboard.
#                      If the default setting of 30 causes lost keystrokes, increase the number.
#                      Or experiment with decreasing the number for applications that accept keystrokes quickly.
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#   mouse_emulation: When is mouse emulated ?
#                      integration: when not locked
#                      locked:      when locked
#                      always:      every time
#                      never:       at no time
#                      If disabled, the mouse position in DOSBox-X is exactly where the host OS reports it.
#                      When using a high DPI mouse, the emulation of mouse movement can noticeably reduce the
#                      sensitiveness of your device, i.e. the mouse is slower but more precise.
#                      Possible values: integration, locked, always, never.
#   mouse_wheel_key: Convert mouse wheel movements into keyboard presses such as arrow keys.
#                      0: disabled; 1: up/down arrows; 2: left/right arrows; 3: PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      Putting a minus sign in front will disable the conversion for guest systems.
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.
#                      If set to "auto" (default), it is enabled for SDL1 and non-US keyboards.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          titlebar: Change the string displayed in the DOSBox-X title bar.
#         showbasic: If set, DOSBox-X will show basic information including the DOSBox-X version number and current running speed in the title bar.
#       showdetails: If set, DOSBox-X will show the cycles count (FPS) and emulation speed relative to realtime in the title bar.
#          showmenu: Whether to show the menu bar (if supported). Default true.

#              autosave: Enable the auto-save state feature. Specify a time interval in seconds, and optionally a save slot or start and end save slots.
#                          For example, "autosave=10 11-20" will set a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the save slots used will be between 11 and 20.
#                          You can additionally specify up to 9 programs for this feature, e.g. "autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35" for "EDIT" and "EDITOR".
#                          Putting a minus sign (-) before the time interval causes the auto-saving function to not be activated at start.

#               memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox-X has in megabytes.
#                          This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#                          although other games and applications may require a higher value.
#                          Programs that use 286 protected mode like Windows 3.0 in Standard Mode may crash with more than 15MB.

#        frameskip: How many frames DOSBox-X skips before drawing one.
#           aspect: Aspect ratio correction mode. Can be set to the following values:
#                       'false' (default):
#                           'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in disproportional image
#                           'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction (default), resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel ratio is not 4:3
#                       'true':
#                           'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output to proportional 4:3 image
#                               In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image is upscaled).
#                               Should have none to negligible impact on performance, mostly being done in hardware
#                               For the pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to enable this whenever the emulated display has an aspect ratio of 4:3
#                           'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct output to 4:3 ratio)
#                               Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x will work poorly
#                               Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact on performance
#                               When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of the above apply
#                     Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#             euro: Display Euro symbol instead of the specified ASCII character (33-255).
#                     For example, setting it to 128 allows Euro symbol to be displayed instead of C-cedilla.
#       doublescan: If set, doublescanned output emits two scanlines for each source line, in the
#                     same manner as the actual VGA output (320x200 is rendered as 640x400 for example).
#                     If clear, doublescanned output is rendered at the native source resolution (320x200 as 320x200).
#                     This affects the raster PRIOR to the software or hardware scalers. Choose wisely.
#                     For pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to turn this option off.
#           scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. If 'forced' is appended,
#                     then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#                     To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                     To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                     Scalers should work with most output options, but they are ignored for openglpp and TrueType font outputs.
#                     Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.
#         glshader: Path to GLSL shader source to use with OpenGL output ("none" to disable, or "default" for default shader).
#                     Can be either an absolute path, a file in the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X configuration directory,
#                     or one of the built-in shaders (e.g. "sharp" for the pixel-perfect scaling mode):
#                     advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp.
#      pixelshader: Set Direct3D pixel shader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory). If 'forced' is appended,
#                     then the pixel shader will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#          autofit: Best fits image to window
#                     - Intended for output=direct3d, fullresolution=original, aspect=true
#   monochrome_pal: Specify the color of monochrome display.
#                     Possible values: green, amber, gray, white
#                     Append 'bright' for a brighter look.
#                     Possible values: green, amber, gray, white.
#         ttf.font: Specifies a TrueType font to use for the TTF output. If not specified, the built-in TrueType font will be used.
#                     Either a font name or full font path can be specified. If file ends with the .TTF extension then the extension can be omitted.
#                     For a font name or relative path, directories such as the working directory and default system font directory will be searched.
#                     For example, setting it to "consola" or "consola.ttf" will use the Consola font; similar for other TTF fonts.

#   multipage: Adds all pages to one PostScript file or printer job until CTRL-F2 is pressed.
#      device: Specify the Windows printer device to use. You can see the list of devices from the Help
#                  menu ('List printer devices') or the Status Window. Then make your choice and put either
#                  the printer device number (e.g. 2) or your printer name (e.g. Microsoft Print to PDF).

#                             xms: Enable XMS support.
#                     xms handles: Number of XMS handles available for the DOS environment, or 0 to use a reasonable default
# shell configuration as commands: Allow entering dosbox-x.conf configuration parameters as shell commands to get and set settings.
#                                    This is disabled by default to avoid conflicts between commands and executables.
#                                    It is recommended to get and set dosbox-x.conf settings using the CONFIG command instead.
#                                    Compatibility with DOSBox SVN can be improved by enabling this option.
#                             hma: Report through XMS that HMA exists (not necessarily available)
#                        ansi.sys: If set (by default), ANSI.SYS emulation is on. If clear, ANSI.SYS is not emulated and will not appear to be installed.
#                                    NOTE: This option has no effect in PC-98 mode where MS-DOS systems integrate ANSI.SYS into the DOS kernel.
#                           share: Report SHARE.EXE as resident. This will allow file locking to be performed, although not all SHARE functions are emulated.
#               file access tries: If a positive integer is set, DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock files directly on mounted local drives for the specified number of times before failing on Windows systems.
#              network redirector: Report DOS network redirector as resident. This will allow the host name to be returned unless the secure mode is enabled.
#                                    Set either "ipx=true" in [ipx] section or "ne2000=true" in [ne2000] section for a full network redirector environment.
#                minimum mcb free: Minimum free segment value to leave free. At startup, the DOS kernel will allocate memory
#                                    up to this point. This can be used to deal with EXEPACK issues or DOS programs that cannot
#                                    be loaded too low in memory. If you want more free conventional memory to be reported,
#                                    you can for example set its value to 1.
#                            dosv: Enable DOS/V emulation and specify which version to emulate. This option is intended for
#                                    use with games or software originating from Asia that use the double byte character set
#                                    encodings and the DOS/V extensions to display Japanese, Chinese, or Korean text.
#                                    Note that enabling DOS/V replaces 80x25 text mode (INT 10h mode 3) with a EGA/VGA graphics
#                                    mode that emulates text mode to display the characters and may be incompatible with non-Asian
#                                    software that assumes direct access to the text mode via segment 0xB800.
#                                    WARNING: This option is very experimental at this time.
#                                    Possible values: off, japanese, chinese, korean.
#                             ems: Enable EMS support. The default (=true) provides the best
#                                    compatibility but certain applications may run better with
#                                    other choices, or require EMS support to be disabled (=false)
#                                    to work at all.
#                                    Possible values: true, emsboard, emm386, false, 1, 0.
#                             umb: Enable UMB support.
#                    quick reboot: If set, the DOS restart call will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated DOS or guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine.
#                                    
#                             ver: Set DOS version. Specify as major.minor format. A single number is treated as the major version (compatible with LFN support). Common settings are:
#                                    auto (or unset)                  Pick a DOS kernel version automatically

#                                    Long filename (LFN) support will be enabled with a reported DOS version of 7.0 or higher with "lfn=auto" (default).
#                                    Similarly, FAT32 disk images will be supported with a reported DOS version of 7.1 or higher.
#                                    
#                             lfn: Enable long filename support. If set to auto (default), it is enabled if the reported DOS version is at least 7.0.
#                                    If set to autostart, the builtin VER command won't activate/disactivate LFN support according to the reported DOS version.
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto, autostart.

#                    automountall: Automatically mount all available Windows drives at start.
#                    mountwarning: If set, a warning will be displayed if you try to mount C:\ in Windows or / in other platforms.
#                  autofixwarning: If set to true or both, DOSBox-X will show messages when trying to automatically fix the "Packed file is corrupt" error.
#                                    If set to false or none, DOSBox-X will not show such messages on the screen when the error occurred.
#                                    If set to "a20fix" or "loadfix", DOSBox-X will show the message for the a20fix or the loadfix only.
#                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, both, a20fix, loadfix, none.
#                        startcmd: Allow starting Windows programs or commands to run on the Windows host including the use of START command.
#                       startwait: Specify whether DOSBox-X should wait for the Windows applications after they are started.
#                      startquiet: If set, before launching Windows applications to run on the host DOSBox-X will not show messages like "Now run it as a Windows application".

#                                    Setting to "read" will only allow read access, and setting to "write" will only allow write access.
#                                    Setting to "full" or "true" enables both; setting to "false" or "disabled" disables the access or device.
#                                    The default device name is CLIP$, but can be changed with the "dos clipboard device name" setting below.
#       dos clipboard device name: Set DOS device name (up to 8 characters) for bidirectional communications with the shared clipboard.
#                                    If unset or invalid, the default name CLIP$ will be used (e.g. "TYPE CLIP$" shows the clipboard contents).
#                                    It has no effect if "dos clipboard device enable" is disabled, and it is deactivated if the secure mode is enabled.
#               dos clipboard api: If set, DOS APIs for communications with the Windows clipboard will be enabled for shared clipboard communications.
