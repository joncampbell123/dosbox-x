# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 0.83.13. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.
# To write out ALL options, use command 'config -all' with -wc or -writeconf options.

[sdl]
#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#    windowposition: Set the window position at startup in the positionX,positionY format (e.g.: 1300,200)
#           display: Specify a screen/display number to use for a multi-screen setup (0 = default).
#            output: What video system to use for output (openglnb = OpenGL nearest; openglpp = OpenGL perfect; ttf = TrueType font output).
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, ttf, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, ddraw, direct3d.
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
# clip_mouse_button: Select the mouse button or use arrow keys for the shared clipboard copy/paste function.
#                      The default mouse button is "right", which means using the right mouse button to select text, copy to and paste from the host clipboard.
#                      Set to "middle" to use the middle mouse button, "arrows" to use arrow keys instead of a mouse button, or "none" to disable this feature.
#                      Possible values: none, middle, right, arrows.
# clip_key_modifier: Change the keyboard modifier for the shared clipboard copy/paste function using a mouse button or arrow keys.
#                      The default modifier is "shift" (both left and right shift keys). Set to "none" if no modifier is desired.
#                      Possible values: none, ctrl, lctrl, rctrl, alt, lalt, ralt, shift, lshift, rshift, ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, lctrlalt, lctrlshift, laltshift, rctrlalt, rctrlshift, raltshift.
#   clip_paste_bios: Specify whether to use BIOS keyboard functions for the clipboard pasting instead of the keystroke method.
#                      For pasting clipboard text into Windows 3.x/9x applications (e.g. Notepad), make sure to use the keystroke method.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, default.
#  clip_paste_speed: Set keyboard speed for pasting text from the shared clipboard.
#                      If the default setting of 30 causes lost keystrokes, increase the number.
#                      Or experiment with decreasing the number for applications that accept keystrokes quickly.
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#   mouse_emulation: When is mouse emulated ?
#                      integration: when not locked
#                      locked:      when locked
#                      always:      every time
#                      never:       at no time
#                      If disabled, the mouse position in DOSBox-X is exactly where the host OS reports it.
#                      When using a high DPI mouse, the emulation of mouse movement can noticeably reduce the
#                      sensitiveness of your device, i.e. the mouse is slower but more precise.
#                      Possible values: integration, locked, always, never.
#   mouse_wheel_key: Convert mouse wheel movements into keyboard presses such as arrow keys.
#                      0: disabled; 1: up/down arrows; 2: left/right arrows; 3: PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      Putting a minus sign in front will disable the conversion for guest systems.
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.
#                      If set to "auto" (default), it is enabled for SDL1 and non-US keyboards.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          titlebar: Change the string displayed in the DOSBox-X title bar.
#         showbasic: If set, DOSBox-X will show basic information including the DOSBox-X version number and current running speed in the title bar.
#       showdetails: If set, DOSBox-X will show the cycles count (FPS) and emulation speed relative to realtime in the title bar.
#          showmenu: Whether to show the menu bar (if supported). Default true.

#  working directory option: Select an option for DOSBox-X's working directory when it runs.
#                              autoprompt: DOSBox-X will auto-decide whether to prompt for a working directory.
#                              config: DOSBox-X will use the primary config file directory as the working directory.
#                              custom: Specify a working directory via the "working directory default" option.
#                              default: Similar to autoprompt, but DOSBox-X will ask whether to save the selected folder.
#                              force: Similar to "custom", while overriding -defaultdir command-line option if used.
#                              noprompt: DOSBox-X uses the current directory and never prompts for a working directory.
#                              program: DOSBox-X will use the DOSBox-X program directory as the working directory.
#                              prompt: DOSBox-X will always ask the user to select a working directory when it runs.
#                              userconfig: DOSBox-X will use its user configuration directory as the working directory.
#                              Possible values: autoprompt, config, custom, default, force, noprompt, program, prompt, userconfig.
# working directory default: The default directory to act as DOSBox-X's working directory. See also the setting "working directory option".
#                              For working directory option=prompt, the specified directory becomes the default directory for the folder selection.
#     show advanced options: If set, the Configuration Tool will display all config options (including advanced ones) by default.
#       resolve config path: If set to true, DOSBox-X will resolve options containing paths in the config file (except [autoexec] section).
#                              This includes environment variables (%VAR% [DOS/Windows] or ${VAR} [Linux/macOS] and tilde (~) in Linux/macOS.
#                              If set to dosvar, DOSBox-X forces to resolve DOS-style environment variables (%VAR%) in all platforms (and tilde).
#                              If set to tilde, DOSBox-X will only resolve tilde (~) in Linux/macOS but will not resolve environment variables.
#                              Possible values: true, false, dosvar, tilde, 1, 0.
#                   hostkey: By default, DOSBox-X uses the mapper-defined host key, which defaults to F11 on Windows and F12 on other platforms.
#                              You may alternatively specify a host key with this setting and bypass the host key as defined in the mapper.
#                              This can also be done from the menu ("Main" => "Select host key").
#                              Possible values: ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, mapper.
#           mapper send key: Select the key the mapper SendKey function will send.
#                              Possible values: winlogo, winmenu, alttab, ctrlesc, ctrlbreak, ctrlaltdel.
#          synchronize time: If set, DOSBox-X will try to automatically synchronize time with the host, unless you decide to change the date/time manually.
#                   machine: The type of machine DOSBox-X tries to emulate.
#                              Possible values: hercules, cga, cga_mono, cga_rgb, cga_composite, cga_composite2, tandy, pcjr, ega, vgaonly, svga_s3, svga_s386c928, svga_s3vision864, svga_s3vision868, svga_s3trio32, svga_s3trio64, svga_s3trio64v+, svga_s3virge, svga_s3virgevx, svga_et3000, svga_et4000, svga_paradise, vesa_nolfb, vesa_oldvbe, amstrad, pc98, pc9801, pc9821, fm_towns, mcga, mda.

#                  autosave: Enable the auto-save state feature. Specify a time interval in seconds, and optionally a save slot or start and end save slots.
#                              For example, "autosave=10 11-20" will set a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the save slots used will be between 11 and 20.
#                              You can additionally specify up to 9 programs for this feature, e.g. "autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35" for "EDIT" and "EDITOR".
#                              Putting a minus sign (-) before the time interval causes the auto-saving function to not be activated at start.

#                  savefile: Select the default save file to save/load states. If specified it will be used instead of the save slot.
#                saveremark: If set, the save state feature will ask users to enter remarks when saving a state.
#            forceloadstate: If set, DOSBox-X will load a saved state even if it finds there is a mismatch in the DOSBox-X version, machine type, program name and/or the memory size.
#                   memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox-X has in megabytes.
#                              This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#                              although other games and applications may require a higher value.
#                              Programs that use 286 protected mode like Windows 3.0 in Standard Mode may crash with more than 15MB.

#                           'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in disproportional image
#                           'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction (default), resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel ratio is not 4:3
#                       'true':
#                           'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output to proportional 4:3 image
#                               In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image is upscaled).
#                               Should have none to negligible impact on performance, mostly being done in hardware
#                               For the pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to enable this whenever the emulated display has an aspect ratio of 4:3
#                           'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct output to 4:3 ratio)
#                               Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x will work poorly
#                               Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact on performance
#                               When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of the above apply
#                     Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#             euro: Display Euro symbol instead of the specified ASCII character (33-255).
#                     For example, setting it to 128 allows Euro symbol to be displayed instead of C-cedilla.

#                     same manner as the actual VGA output (320x200 is rendered as 640x400 for example).
#                     If clear, doublescanned output is rendered at the native source resolution (320x200 as 320x200).
#                     This affects the raster PRIOR to the software or hardware scalers. Choose wisely.
#                     For pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to turn this option off.
#           scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. If 'forced' is appended,
#                     then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#                     To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                     To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                     Scalers should work with most output options, but they are ignored for openglpp and TrueType font outputs.
#                     Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.
#         glshader: Path to GLSL shader source to use with OpenGL output ("none" to disable, or "default" for default shader).
#                     Can be either an absolute path, a file in the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X configuration directory,
#                     or one of the built-in shaders (e.g. "sharp" for the pixel-perfect scaling mode):
#                     advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp.
#      pixelshader: Set Direct3D pixel shader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory). If 'forced' is appended,
#                     then the pixel shader will be used even if the result might not be desired.

#                     - Intended for output=direct3d, fullresolution=original, aspect=true
#   monochrome_pal: Specify the color of monochrome display.
#                     Possible values: green, amber, gray, white

#                     Possible values: green, amber, gray, white.
#         ttf.font: Specifies a TrueType font to use for the TTF output. If not specified, the built-in TrueType font will be used.
#                     Either a font name or full font path can be specified. If file ends with the .TTF extension then the extension can be omitted.
#                     For a font name or relative path, directories such as the working directory and default system font directory will be searched.
#                     For example, setting it to "consola" or "consola.ttf" will use the Consola font; similar for other TTF fonts.
# ttf.outputswitch: Specifies the output that DOSBox-X should switch to from the TTF output when a graphical mode is requiested, or auto for automatic selection.
#                     Possible values: auto, surface, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, direct3d.
#      ttf.winperc: Specifies the window percentage for the TTF output (100 = full screen). Ignored if the ttf.ptsize setting is specified.
#       ttf.ptsize: Specifies the font point size for the TTF output. If specified (minimum: 9), it will override the ttf.winperc setting.
#         ttf.lins: Specifies the number of rows on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#         ttf.cols: Specifies the number of columns on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#           ttf.wp: You can specify a word processor for the TTF output (WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite) and optionally also a version number.
#                     For example, WP6 will set the word processor as WordPerfect 6, and XY4 will set the word processor as XyWrite 4.
#                     Word processor-specific features like on-screen text styles and 512-character font will be enabled based on this.
#       ttf.blinkc: If set to true, the cursor blinks for the TTF output; setting it to false will turn the blinking off.
#                     You can also change the blinking rate by setting an interger between 1 (fastest) and 7 (slowest), or 0 for no cursor.

#                                 It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#                 'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
#                                 need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#                 'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to

# shell configuration as commands: Allow entering dosbox-x.conf configuration parameters as shell commands to get and set settings.
#                                    This is disabled by default to avoid conflicts between commands and executables.
#                                    It is recommended to get and set dosbox-x.conf settings using the CONFIG command instead.
#                                    Compatibility with DOSBox SVN can be improved by enabling this option.
#                             hma: Report through XMS that HMA exists (not necessarily available)
#      hard drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) hard disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                    Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 (default) to use a reasonable limit.
#                                    The disk I/O performance as in DOSBox SVN can be achieved by setting this to 0.
#                        ansi.sys: If set (by default), ANSI.SYS emulation is on. If clear, ANSI.SYS is not emulated and will not appear to be installed.
#                                    NOTE: This option has no effect in PC-98 mode where MS-DOS systems integrate ANSI.SYS into the DOS kernel.
#                           share: Report SHARE.EXE as resident. This will allow file locking to be performed, although not all SHARE functions are emulated.
#               file access tries: If a positive integer is set, DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock files directly on mounted local drives for the specified number of times before failing on Windows systems.
#              network redirector: Report DOS network redirector as resident. This will allow the host name to be returned unless the secure mode is enabled.
#                                    Set either "ipx=true" in [ipx] section or "ne2000=true" in [ne2000] section for a full network redirector environment.
#                minimum mcb free: Minimum free segment value to leave free. At startup, the DOS kernel will allocate memory
#                                    up to this point. This can be used to deal with EXEPACK issues or DOS programs that cannot
#                                    be loaded too low in memory. If you want more free conventional memory to be reported,
#                                    you can for example set its value to 1.
#                            dosv: Enable DOS/V emulation and specify which version to emulate. This option is intended for
#                                    use with games or software originating from Asia that use the double byte character set
#                                    encodings and the DOS/V extensions to display Japanese, Chinese, or Korean text.
#                                    Note that enabling DOS/V replaces 80x25 text mode (INT 10h mode 3) with a EGA/VGA graphics
#                                    mode that emulates text mode to display the characters and may be incompatible with non-Asian
#                                    software that assumes direct access to the text mode via segment 0xB800.
#                                    WARNING: This option is very experimental at this time.
#                                    Possible values: off, japanese, chinese, korean.
#                             ems: Enable EMS support. The default (=true) provides the best
#                                    compatibility but certain applications may run better with
#                                    other choices, or require EMS support to be disabled (=false)

#                             umb: Enable UMB support.
#                    quick reboot: If set, the DOS restart call will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated DOS or guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine.
#                                    
#                             ver: Set DOS version. Specify as major.minor format. A single number is treated as the major version (compatible with LFN support). Common settings are:
