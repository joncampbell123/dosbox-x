# This is the configurationfile for DOSBox 0.74. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox)
# Lines starting with a # are commentlines and are ignored by DOSBox.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.

[sdl]
#       fullscreen: Start dosbox directly in fullscreen. (Press ALT-Enter to go back)
#       fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox.
#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original or fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                     Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                     If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
# windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                     (output=surface does not!)
#           output: What video system to use for output.
#                   Possible values: surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb.
#         autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
#      sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity.
#      waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#         priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                     pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                   Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#       mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the defaul value.
#     usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.

[dosbox]
#  language: Select another language file.
#   machine: The type of machine tries to emulate.
#            Possible values: hercules, cga, tandy, pcjr, ega, vgaonly, svga_s3, svga_et3000, svga_et4000, svga_paradise, vesa_nolfb, vesa_oldvbe, amstrad.
#  captures: Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
#   memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox has in megabytes.
#              This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#              though few games might require a higher value.
#              There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
# memsizekb: Amount of memory DOSBox has in kilobytes.
#              This value should normally be set to 0.
#              If nonzero, overrides the memsize parameter.
#              Finer grained control of total memory may be useful in
#              emulating ancient DOS machines with less than 640KB of
#              RAM or early 386 systems with odd extended memory sizes.
#            
#  memalias: Memory aliasing emulation, in number of valid address bits.
#            . Many 386/486 class motherboards and processors prior to 1995
#              suffered from memory aliasing for various technical reasons. If the software you are
#              trying to run assumes aliasing, or otherwise plays cheap tricks with paging,
#              enabling this option can help. Note that enabling this option can cause slight performance degredation. Set to 0 to disable.
#              Recommended values when enabled:
#                24: 16MB aliasing. Common on 386SX systems (CPU had 24 external address bits)
#                    or 386DX and 486 systems where the CPU communicated directly with the ISA bus (A24-A31 tied off)
#                26: 64MB aliasing. Some 486s had only 26 external address bits, some motherboards tied off A26-A31

# frameskip: How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
#    aspect: Do aspect correction, if your output method doesn't support scaling this can slow things down!.
#    scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
#              If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#            Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x.

#       core: CPU Core used in emulation. auto will switch to dynamic if available and appropriate.
#             Possible values: auto, dynamic, normal, simple.

#             Possible values: auto, 386, 386_slow, 486_slow, pentium_slow, 386_prefetch.
#     cycles: Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
#             Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#             Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#               'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                               It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#               'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually need if 'auto' fails.
#                               (Example: fixed 4000).
#               'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to handle.
#             
#             Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#  forcerate: Force the VGA framerate to a specific value, no matter what
#    cycleup: Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with keycombo.(CTRL-F11/CTRL-F12)
#  cycledown: Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
#    cgasnow: When machine=cga, determines whether or not to emulate CGA snow
# isapnpbios: Emulate ISA Plug & Play BIOS. Enable if using DOSBox to run a PnP aware DOS program or if booting Windows 9x.
#             Do not disable if Windows 9x is configured around PnP devices, you will likely confuse it.
