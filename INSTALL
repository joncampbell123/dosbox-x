Some Information for Installation and Compilation of DOSBox-X
=============================================================

For the latest releases of DOSBox-X please go to the Releases page:
https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases

You will find pre-compiled Windows binaries (both 32-bit and 64-bit),
Linux RPM packages (64-bit), macOS packages (64-bit) and the special
HX-DOS packages (for real DOS environments) from the Releases page.

For each DOSBox-X version there are generally three zip packages for
the Windows platform, built with Visual Studio, MinGW 32-bit and
MinGW 64-bit respectively. For example, in the case of DOSBox-X
version 0.83.2, they correspond to the following:

dosbox-x-windows-20200531-220809-windows.zip
dosbox-x-mingw-win32-20200531151931.zip
dosbox-x-mingw-win64-20200531160500.zip

Select one of the zip packages to download and unzip, then you will
find various directories, which are some supported targets (e.g. Win32
and x64). Go to a target folder and run dosbox-x.exe inside it, then
DOSBox-X will be launched and ready to be used.

You may also find all-in-one Windows installer packages elsewhere. The
installation process will be automated while allowing you to change
the default build to run if you prefer, and you will be able to start
DOSBox-X as soon as the installation ends. A quick start guide is also
included in the package.

On the other hand, the following RPM packages are for Linux platform:

dosbox-x-0.83.2-0.el7.x86_64.rpm
dosbox-x-0.83.2-0.el8.x86_64.rpm
dosbox-x-debuginfo-0.83.2-0.el7.x86_64.rpm
dosbox-x-debuginfo-0.83.2-0.el8.x86_64.rpm
dosbox-x-debugsource-0.83.2-0.el8.x86_64.rpm

Pick a RPM package for your Linux platform and install.

In addition, there are also packages for the macOS and DOS platforms.
The following two zip files are the macOS package and the special
HX-DOS package respectively:

dosbox-x-macosx-x64-20200531151047.zip
dosbox-x-mingw-hx-dos-20200531220949.zip

With the HX-DOS package DOSBox-X can be run in real DOS too, although
not all features of DOSBox-X can be supported in this environment.

Note: You may not see all such packages for some DOSBox-X versions.

You can also compile DOSBox-X from the source code by yourself. Below
are some old information for compiling the DOSBox-X source code, which
may be somewhat outdated. See also the README.source-code-description
file for updated and more detailed information on building the
DOSBox-X source code and other related information.

Things needed for compilation of the source code.

SDL 1.2.x or SDL 2.0.x
    The Simple DirectMedia Library available at http://www.libsdl.org
    The DLL distributed with the Windows SDL1 version of DOSBox-X had
    been modified from the original. You can find the changes in the
    source package of DOSBox-X (src/platform/sdl-win32.diff). If you
    want the patched source tree send us an email. (see README)
    Licensed under LGPL
    Note that only version 1.2.x (SDL1 version) and version 2.0.x
    (SDL2 version) are currently supported.

Curses (optional)
    If you want to enable the debugger you need a curses library.
    ncurses should be installed on just about every unix distro.
    For win32 get pdcurses at http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net
    License: Open source

Libpng (optional)
    Needed for the screenshots.
    For win32 get libpng from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html
    See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ for more details.
    License: Open Source

Zlib (optional)
    Needed by libpng.
    For win32 get libz (rename to zlib) from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html
    See http://www.zlib.net for more details.
    License: Open Source

SDL_Net (optional)
    For modem/ipx support. Get it from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
    Licensed under LGPL

SDL_Sound 
    For compressed audio on diskimages. (optional)
    This is for cue/bin cdrom images with compressed (mp3/ogg) audio tracks.
    Get it from http://icculus.org/SDL_sound
    Licenced under LGPL

ALSA_Headers
    (optional)
    for Alsa support under linux. Part of the linux kernel sources
    Licensed under LGPL

If you want compile from developer sources (SVN) under a unix system, you'll also need 
automake (>=1.6), autoconf(>=2.50). Should be available at http://www.gnu.org

For building on unix systems.
If you are building from developer sources run ./autogen.sh first before doing the following.

1. ./configure
2. make

In step 1 you could add the following switches:
--enable-debug 
        enables the internal debugger. --enable-debug=heavy enables even more 
        debug options. DOSBox-X should then be run from a xterm and when the sdl-
        window is active press alt-pause to enter the debugger.

--enable-core-inline
        enables some memory increasing inlines. This greatly increases 
        compiletime for maybe a increase in speed.

--disable-fpu
        disables the emulated fpu. Although the fpu emulation code isn't 
        finished and isn't entirely accurate it's advised to leave it on. 

--disable-fpu-x86
--disable-fpu-x64
        disables the assembly fpu core. Although relatively new, the x86/x64 fpu  
        core has more accuracy then the regular fpu core. 

--disable-dynamic-x86
        disables the dynamic x86 specific cpu core. Although it might be 
        be a bit unstable, it can greatly improve the speed of dosbox-x on x86 
        hosts.
        Please note that this option on x86 will result in a different
        dynamic/recompiling cpu core being compiled then the default.
        For more information see the option --disable-dynrec

--disable-dynrec
        disables the recompiling cpu core. Currently x86 and x86_64 only.
        You can activate this core on x86 by disabling the dynamic-x86 core.

--disable-dynamic-core
        disables all dynamic cores. (same effect as 
        --disable-dynamic-x86 --disable-dynrec)

--disable-opengl
        disables OpenGL-support (output mode that can be selected in the
        DOSBox-X configuration file).

--disable-unaligned-memory
        disables unaligned memory access.

Check the src subdir for the binary.

NOTE: If capslock and numlock appear to be broken. open
src/ints/bios_keyboard.cpp and go to line 30 and read there how to fix it.


Build instructions for VC++6 
Don't use VC++ 6: it creates faulty code in core_normal.cpp
Later Visual Studio versions work fine (vs2003/.net up to vs2010)
