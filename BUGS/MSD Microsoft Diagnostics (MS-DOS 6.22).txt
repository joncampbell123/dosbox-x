If no floppies are mounted, MSD.EXE reports two 5.25" 360KB floppy drives (wrong!).
If at least one floppy drive is mounted, MSD.EXE correctly reports the floppy drives in the system.

If running MSD.EXE from DOSBox's internal command prompt, MSD.EXE reports a 360KB floppy drive with
wildly incorrect geometry (264 tracks and 40 heads!) and DOSBox prints a debug message stating that
an unsupported IOCTL was issued. Hm...
