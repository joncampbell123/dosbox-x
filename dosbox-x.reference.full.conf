# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 2025.05.03. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.
# To write out ALL options, use command 'config -all' with -wc or -writeconf options.

[sdl]
#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#    windowposition: Set the window position at startup in the positionX,positionY format (e.g.: 1300,200).
#                      The window will be centered with "," (or empty), and will be in the original position with "-".
#           display: Specify a screen/display number to use for a multi-screen setup (0 = default).
#            output: What video system to use for output (surface = software (SDL_Surface); openglnb = OpenGL nearest; openglpp = OpenGL perfect; ttf = TrueType font output).
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, ttf, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, ddraw, direct3d.
#       videodriver: Forces a video driver (e.g. windib/windows, directx, x11, fbcon, dummy, etc) for the SDL library to use.
#      transparency: Set the transparency of the DOSBox-X screen (both windowed and full-screen modes, on SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds).
#                      The valid value is from 0 (no transparency, the default setting) to 90 (high transparency).
#          maximize: If set, the DOSBox-X window will be maximized at start (SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds only; use fullscreen for TTF output).
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
# autolock_feedback: Autolock status feedback type, i.e. visual, auditive, none.
#                      Possible values: none, beep, flash.
#     middle_unlock: Whether you can press the middle mouse button to unlock the mouse when the mouse has been locked.
#                      If set to "manual", it works only with "autolock=false"; if set to "auto", it works only with "autolock=true".
#                      Possible values: none, manual, auto, both.
# clip_mouse_button: Select the mouse button or use arrow keys for the shared clipboard copy/paste function.
#                      The default mouse button is "right", which means using the right mouse button to select text, copy to and paste from the host clipboard.
#                      Set to "middle" to use the middle mouse button, "arrows" to use arrow keys instead of a mouse button, or "none" to disable this feature.
#                      For "arrows", press Home key (or Fn+Shift+Left on Mac laptops) to start selection, and End key (or Fn+Shift+Right on Mac laptops) to end selection.
#                      Possible values: none, middle, right, arrows.
# clip_key_modifier: Change the keyboard modifier for the shared clipboard copy/paste function using a mouse button or arrow keys.
#                      The default modifier is "shift" (both left and right shift keys). Set to "none" if no modifier is desired.
#                      Possible values: none, ctrl, lctrl, rctrl, alt, lalt, ralt, shift, lshift, rshift, ctrlalt, ctrlshift, altshift, lctrlalt, lctrlshift, laltshift, rctrlalt, rctrlshift, raltshift.
#   clip_paste_bios: Specify whether to use BIOS keyboard functions for the clipboard pasting instead of the keystroke method.
#                      For pasting clipboard text into Windows 3.x/9x applications (e.g. Notepad), make sure to use the keystroke method.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, default.
#  clip_paste_speed: Set keyboard speed for pasting text from the shared clipboard.
#                      If the default setting of 30 causes lost keystrokes, increase the number.
#                      Or experiment with decreasing the number for applications that accept keystrokes quickly.
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#   usesystemcursor: Use the mouse cursor of the host system instead of drawing a DOS mouse cursor. Activated when the mouse is not locked.
#   mouse_emulation: When is mouse emulated ?
#                      integration: when not locked
#                      locked:      when locked
#                      always:      every time
#                      never:       at no time
#                      If disabled, the mouse position in DOSBox-X is exactly where the host OS reports it.
#                      When using a high DPI mouse, the emulation of mouse movement can noticeably reduce the
#                      sensitiveness of your device, i.e. the mouse is slower but more precise.
#                      Possible values: integration, locked, always, never.
#   mouse_wheel_key: Convert mouse wheel movements into keyboard presses such as arrow keys.
#                      0: disabled; 1: up/down arrows; 2: left/right arrows; 3: PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      4: Ctrl+up/down arrows; 5: Ctrl+left/right arrows; 6: Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn keys.
#                      7: Ctrl+W/Z, as supported by text editors like WordStar and MS-DOS EDIT.
#                      Putting a minus sign in front will disable the conversion for guest systems.
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#   mapperfile_sdl1: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from DOSBox-X SDL1 builds. If set it will override "mapperfile" for SDL1 builds.
#   mapperfile_sdl2: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from DOSBox-X SDL2 builds. If set it will override "mapperfile" for SDL2 builds.
# forcesquarecorner: If set, DOSBox-X will force square corners (instead of round corners) for the DOSBox-X window when running in Windows 11.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, in favor of scancodes. Might not work on all operating systems.
#                      If set to "auto" (default), it is enabled when using non-US keyboards in SDL1 builds.
#                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#          overscan: Width of the overscan border (0 to 10) for the "surface" output.
#          titlebar: Change the string displayed in the DOSBox-X title bar.
#         showbasic: If set, DOSBox-X will show basic information including the DOSBox-X version number and current running speed in the title bar.
#       showdetails: If set, DOSBox-X will show the cycles count (FPS) and emulation speed relative to realtime in the title bar.
#          showmenu: Whether to show the menu bar (if supported). Default true.

#                       working directory default: The default directory to act as DOSBox-X's working directory. See also the setting "working directory option".
#                                                    For working directory option=prompt, the specified directory becomes the default directory for the folder selection.
#                           show advanced options: If set, the Configuration Tool will display all config options (including advanced ones) by default.
#                             resolve config path: If set to true, DOSBox-X will resolve options containing paths in the config file (except [autoexec] section).
#                                                    This includes environment variables (%VAR% [DOS/Windows] or ${VAR} [Linux/macOS] and tilde (~) in Linux/macOS.
#                                                    If set to dosvar, DOSBox-X forces to resolve DOS-style environment variables (%VAR%) in all platforms (and tilde).
#                                                    If set to tilde, DOSBox-X will only resolve tilde (~) in Linux/macOS but will not resolve environment variables.

#                                         hostkey: By default, DOSBox-X uses the mapper-defined host key, which defaults to F11 on Windows and F12 on other platforms.
#                                                    You may alternatively specify a host key with this setting and bypass the host key as defined in the mapper.
#                                                    This can also be done from the menu ("Main" => "Select host key").

#                                synchronize time: If set, DOSBox-X will try to automatically synchronize time with the host, unless you decide to change the date/time manually.
#                                   keyboard hook: Use keyboard hook (currently only on Windows) to catch special keys and synchronize the keyboard LEDs with the host.
#                                          weitek: If set, emulate the Weitek coprocessor. This option only has effect if cputype=386 or cputype=486.
#                             bochs debug port e9: If set, emulate Bochs debug port E9h. ASCII text written to this I/O port is assumed to be debug output, and logged.

#                                        autosave: Enable the auto-save state feature. Specify a time interval in seconds, and optionally a save slot or start and end save slots.
#                                                    For example, "autosave=10 11-20" will set a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the save slots used will be between 11 and 20.
#                                                    You can additionally specify up to 9 programs for this feature, e.g. "autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35" for "EDIT" and "EDITOR".
#                                                    Putting a minus sign (-) before the time interval causes the auto-saving function to not be activated at start.
#                                        saveslot: Select the default save slot (1-100) to save/load states.
#                                        savefile: Select the default save file to save/load states. If specified it will be used instead of the save slot.
#                          video debug at startup: If set, have video debug displays on by default
#                                      saveremark: If set, the save state feature will ask users to enter remarks when saving a state.
#                                  forceloadstate: If set, DOSBox-X will load a saved state even if it finds there is a mismatch in the DOSBox-X version, machine type, program name and/or the memory size.
#                               compresssaveparts: If set, DOSBox-X will compress components of saved states to save space.
#                          show recorded filename: If set, DOSBox-X will show message boxes with recorded filenames when making audio or video captures.
#                  skip encoding unchanged frames: Unchanged frames will not be sent to the video codec as a possible performance and bandwidth optimization.
#                           capture chroma format: Chroma format to use when capturing to H.264. 'auto' picks the best quality option.
#                                                    4:4:4       Chroma is at full resolution. This provides the best quality, however not widely supported by editing software.
#                                                    4:2:2       Chroma is at half horizontal resolution.
#                                                    4:2:0       Chroma is at quarter resolution, which may cause minor color smearing.
#                                                                However, this chroma format is most likely to be compatible with video editing software.
#                                                    Possible values: auto, 4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0.
#                                  capture format: Capture format to use when capturing video. The availability of the format depends on how DOSBox-X was compiled.
#                                                    default                     Use compiled-in default (avi-zmbv)

#                                                    mpegts-h264                 Use MPEG transport stream + H.264 + AAC audio. Resolution & refresh rate changes can be contained
#                                                                                within one file with this choice, however not all software can support mid-stream format changes.
#                                                    Possible values: default, avi-zmbv, mpegts-h264.
#                          shell environment size: Size of the initial DOSBox-X shell environment block, in bytes. Setting to 0 implies a default size of 720 bytes as in DOSBox.
#                                                    You can increase this size to store more environment variables in DOS, although this does not affect the environment block
#                                                    of sub-processes spawned from the DOS shell. This option has no effect unless the dynamic kernel allocation is enabled.
#                                 shell permanent: If enabled, initial DOSBox-X shell will stay permanent (equivalent to /P switch).
#                               private area size: Set DOSBox-X private memory area size. This area contains private memory structures used by the DOS kernel.
#                                                    It is discarded when you boot into another OS. Mainline DOSBox uses 32KB. Testing shows that it is possible
#                                                    to run DOSBox with as little as 4KB. If DOSBox-X aborts with error "not enough memory for internal tables"
#                                                    then you need to increase this value.
#                                             a20: A20 gate emulation mode.
#                                                    The on/off/on_fake/off_fake options are intended for testing and debugging DOS development,
#                                                    or to emulate obscure hardware, or to work around potential extended memory problems with DOS programs.
#                                                    on_fake/off_fake are intended to test whether a program carries out a memory test to ensure the A20
#                                                    gate is set as intended (as HIMEM.SYS does). If it goes by the gate bit alone, it WILL crash.
#                                                    This parameter is also changeable from the builtin A20GATE command.

#                                                    Enabled by default. Recommended for MS-DOS when HIMEM.SYS is not installed in the guest OS.
#                                                    If disabled, and MS-DOS does not load HIMEM.SYS, programs and features that rely on the 1MB wraparound will fail.

#                                                    This can be used for x86 assembly language experiments and automated testing against the CPU emulation.
#                                   ibm rom basic: If set, this is the path of a ROM image containing IBM ROM BASIC. This is loaded just below the ROM BIOS.

#                                                    There are some old DOS games and demos that have race conditions with IRQs that need a nonzero value here to work properly.
#                                         iodelay: I/O delay in nanoseconds for I/O port access. Set to -1 to use default, 0 to disable.

#                                                    WARNING: This option is very experimental at this time and should not be enabled unless you're willing to accept the consequences.
#                                                             Intended for use with ACPI-aware OSes including Linux and Windows 98/ME. This option will also slightly reduce available
#                                                             system memory to make room for the ACPI tables, just as real BIOSes do, and reserve an IRQ for ACPI functions.

#                           acpi rsd ptr location: Where to store the Root System Description Pointer structure. You can have it stored in the ROM BIOS area, or the Extended Bios Data Area.
#                                                    Possible values: auto, bios, ebda.

#                                     memory file: If set, guest memory is memory-mapped from a file on disk, rather than allocated from memory.
#                                                    This option can help keep DOSBox-X from consuming too much RAM for large values of memsize.
#                                                    This option is required to emulate 4GB or more of RAM. The file will be created if it does not exist
#                                                    and it does not require any special maintenance or formatting.
#                                         memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox-X has in megabytes.
#                                                    This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#                                                    although other games and applications may require a higher value.
#                                                    Programs that use 286 protected mode like Windows 3.0 in Standard Mode may crash with more than 15MB.
#                                                    A memory file is required to emulate a memory size of 4GB or more.
#                                                    The maximum value allowed is affected by the memalias setting which affects the maximum amount of memory CPU can access as a power of 2.
#                                                    The maximum value is also affected by the CPU type. See DOSBox-X console and log file for details.
#                                                    The maximum setting 1048576 represents 1TB and requires at least a Pentium II and PSE-40 emulation.
#                                       memsizekb: Amount of memory DOSBox-X has in kilobytes.
#                                                    This value should normally be set to 0.
#                                                    If nonzero, it is added to the memsize parameter.
#                                                    Finer grained control of total memory may be useful in
#                                                    emulating ancient DOS machines with less than 640KB of
#                                                    RAM or early 386 systems with odd extended memory sizes.
#                                                    For Tandy and PCjr emulation, it is strongly recommended.
#                                                    to specify a size that is a multiple of 32 (kb).

#                                   dos mem limit: Limit DOS conventional memory to this amount. Does not affect extended memory.
#                                                    Setting this option to a value in the range 636-639 can be used to simulate modern BIOSes
#                                                    that maintain an EBDA (Extended BIOS Data Area) at the top of conventional memory.
#                                                    You may also play with this option for diagnostic purposes or to stress test DOS programs in limited memory setups.
#                                                    
#                                                    A few DOS games & demos require this option to be set:
#                                                         Majic 12 "Show": If UMBs are enabled, set this option to 639 to avoid MCB chain corruption error.
#                        isa memory hole at 512kb: If set, emulate an ISA memory hole at the 512KB to 640KB area (0x80000-0x9FFFF).
#                                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                         isa memory hole at 15mb: If set, emulate an ISA memory hole at the 15MB to 16MB area (0xF00000-0xFFFFFF).
#                                                    If auto, hole is disabled by default for IBM compatible modes and enabled by default for NEC PC-98 compatible modes.
#                                                    The reason for this is that the hole is needed for the PC-9821 256-color mode linear framebuffer to work with some DOS games even when memsize >= 16.
#                                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                                    reboot delay: Reboot delay. How long to pause at BIOS POST after reboot in milliseconds.
#                                                    This option is provided so that it is possible to see what the guest application
#                                                    or OS might have written to the screen before resetting the system. A value of
#                                                    -1 means to use a reasonable default.
#                                        memalias: Memory aliasing emulation, in number of valid address bits.
#                                                    Many 386/486 class motherboards and processors prior to 1995
#                                                    had memory aliases for various technical reasons such as having
#                                                    less than 32 address bits on the CPU die.
#                                                    Recommended values when enabled:
#                                                        0: Pick a value automatically according to cputype.
#                                                           NOTE: Changing the cputype after initial startup will not change the auto setting i.e.
#                                                           starting with cputype=8086 will use a memalias of 20 even if you later change cputype to 386.
#                                                        24: 16MB aliasing. Common on 386SX systems (CPU had 24 external address bits)
#                                                            or 386DX and 486 systems where the CPU communicated directly with the ISA bus (A24-A31 tied off)
#                                                        26: 64MB aliasing. Some 486 clones (and 386EX/CX) had only 26 external address bits, some motherboards tied off A26-A31
#                                                        32: 4GB aliasing. This is normal for most 486/Pentium and later systems and is the default for most values of cputype.
#                                                        36: 64GB aliasing. Recommended if you are emulating more than 3.5GB of RAM and Pentium Pro/II Page Size Extensions.
#                                                        40: 1TB aliasing. Recommended if you are emulating more than 63GB of RAM and Pentium Pro/II Page Size Extensions.
#                                      nocachedir: If set, MOUNT commands will mount with -nocachedir (disable directory caching) by default.
#                                     freesizecap: If set to "cap" (="true"), the value of MOUNT -freesize will apply only if the actual free size is greater than the specified value.
#                                                    If set to "relative", the value of MOUNT -freesize will change relative to the specified value.
#                                                    If set to "fixed" (="false"), the value of MOUNT -freesize will be a fixed one to be reported all the time.
#                                                    Possible values: true, false, fixed, relative, cap, 2, 1, 0.
#                                 convertdrivefat: If set, DOSBox-X will auto-convert mounted non-FAT drives (such as local drives) to FAT format for use with guest systems.
#                          convert fat free space: If set, auto-converted FAT images will have the specified free space in MB (except PC-98 FAT12/16 HDI) if less than the actual free space.
#                                                    If set to 0, the converted disk will be read-only; if set to -1, the actual free space on host drive will be used for the converted disk.
#                             convert fat timeout: If set to a positive integer, the FAT auto-conversion will time out after the specified number of seconds.
#               leading colon write protect image: If set, BOOT and IMGMOUNT commands will put an image file name with a leading colon (:) in write-protect mode.
#                        locking disk image mount: If set, BOOT and IMGMOUNT commands will try to lock the mounted disk image files. As a result, you cannot
#                                                    mount the same disk image files in read/write mode at the same time as this can cause possible disk corruptions.
#                  unmask keyboard on int 16 read: If set, INT 16h will unmask IRQ 1 (keyboard) when asked to read keyboard input.
#                                                    It is strongly recommended that you set this option if running Windows 3.11 Windows for Workgroups in DOSBox-X.
# int16 keyboard polling undocumented cf behavior: If set, INT 16h function AH=01h will also set/clear the carry flag depending on whether input was available.
#                                                    There are some old DOS games and demos that rely on this behavior to sense keyboard input, and this behavior
#                                                    has been verified to occur on some old (early 90s) BIOSes.
#                             allow port 92 reset: If set (default), allow the application to reset the CPU through port 92h
#                                  enable port 92: Emulate port 92h (PS/2 system control port A). If you want to emulate a system that pre-dates the PS/2, set to 0.
#                       enable 1st dma controller: Emulate 1st (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a system that lacks DMA (PCjr and some Tandy systems)
#                       enable 2nd dma controller: Emulate 2nd (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a PC/XT system without 16-bit DMA.
#                                                    Note: mainline DOSBox automatically disables 16-bit DMA when machine=cga or machine=hercules, while DOSBox-X does not.
#                     allow dma address decrement: If set, allow increment & decrement modes as specified in the 8237 datasheet.
#                                                    If clear, always increment the address (as if to emulate clone 8237 implementations that skipped the inc/dec bit).
#                  enable 128k capable 16-bit dma: If true, DMA controller emulation models ISA hardware that permits 16-bit DMA to span 128KB.
#                                                    If false, DMA controller emulation models PCI hardware that limits 16-bit DMA to 64KB boundaries.
#                                                    If auto, the choice is made according to other factors in hardware emulation
#                                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                 enable dma extra page registers: If set, emulate the extra page registers (I/O ports 0x80, 0x84-0x86, 0x88, 0x8C-0x8E), like actual hardware.
#                                                    Note that mainline DOSBox behavior is to NOT emulate these registers.
#                   dma page registers write-only: Normally (on AT hardware) the DMA page registers are read/write. Set this option if you want to emulate PC/XT hardware where the page registers are write-only.
#              cascade interrupt never in service: If set, PIC emulation will never mark cascade interrupt as in service. This is OFF by default. It is a hack for troublesome games.
#             cascade interrupt ignore in service: If true, PIC emulation will allow slave pic interrupts even if the cascade interrupt is still "in service" (common PC-98 behavior)
#                                                    If false, PIC emulation will consider cascade in-service state when deciding which interrupt to signal (common IBM PC behavior)

#                                enable slave pic: Enable slave PIC (IRQ 8-15). Set this to 0 if you want to emulate a PC/XT type arrangement with IRQ 0-7 and no IRQ 2 cascade.
#                              enable pc nmi mask: Enable PC/XT style NMI mask register (0xA0). Note that this option conflicts with the secondary PIC and will be ignored if the slave PIC is enabled.
#               allow more than 640kb base memory: If set, and space is available, allow conventional memory to extend past 640KB.
#                                                    For example, if machine=cga, conventional memory can extend out to 0xB800 and provide up to 736KB of RAM.
#                                                    This allows you to emulate PC/XT style memory extensions.
#                                                    For machine=tandy, this enables up to 768KB of memory which is then provided as 640KB to DOS to emulate the Tandy 768KB configuration with no overlap between DOS and video memory

#               frameskip: How many frames DOSBox-X skips before drawing one.
#                  aspect: Aspect ratio correction mode. Can be set to the following values:
#                              'false' (default):
#                                  'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full
#                                     window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in dis-
#                                     proportional image
#                                  'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction,
#                                     resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel
#                                     ratio is not 4:3 (default)
#                              'true':
#                                  'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to
#                                     scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output 
#                                     to proportional 4:3 image
#                                     In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable
#                                    (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image
#                                     is upscaled).
#                                     Should have none to negligible impact on performance,
#                                     mostly being done in hardware.
#                                     For the pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is
#                                     recommended to enable this whenever the emulated display
#                                     has an aspect ratio of 4:3
#                                  'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction
#                                     method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct
#                                     output to 4:3 ratio)
#                                     Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix
#                                     well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x
#                                     will work poorly
#                                     Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact
#                                     on performance.
#                                     When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect
#                                     ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of
#                                     the above apply.
#                            Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#            aspect_ratio: Set the aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9) in the aspect ratio correction mode. 0:0 means the default ratio of 4:3, and -1:-1 means the original image ratio.
#                   char9: Allow 9-pixel wide text mode fonts instead of 8-pixel wide fonts.
#                    euro: Display Euro symbol instead of the specified ASCII character (33-255).
#                            For example, setting it to 128 allows Euro symbol to be displayed instead of C-cedilla.
#              doublescan: If set, doublescanned output emits two scanlines for each source line, in the same manner as the actual VGA output (320x200 is rendered as 640x400 for example).
#                            If clear, doublescanned output is rendered at the native source resolution (320x200 as 320x200).
#                            This affects the raster PRIOR to the software or hardware scalers.
#                            Setting this option may prevent some scalers to work as expected.
#                            Try turning this option off in such case.
#                            For pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is recommended to turn this option off.
#              modeswitch: Let DOSBox-X determine the resolution of the monitor. This feature is only available when DOSBox-X is compiled with SDL2 support.
#                  scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. Add keyword 'forced', after the name of the scaler to always use the scaler even if the result might not be desired.(e.g. 'normal2x forced')
#                            Appending 'prompt' will cause a confirmation message for forcing the scaler.
#                            To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                            To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                            Scalers should work with most output options, but they are ignored for openglpp and TrueType font outputs.
#                            If you are using OpenGL/Direct3D output and a shader that requires it, set to hardware_none or hardware2x.
#                            Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.
#                glshader: Path to GLSL shader source to use with OpenGL output ("none" to disable, or "default" for default shader).
#                            Can be either an absolute path, a file in the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X configuration directory, or one of the built-in shaders (e.g. "sharp" for the pixel-perfect scaling mode):
#                            advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp.
#             pixelshader: Set Direct3D pixel shader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory). If 'forced' is appended, then the pixel shader will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#              xbrz slice: Number of screen lines to process in single xBRZ scaler taskset task, affects xBRZ performance, 16 is the default
# xbrz fixed scale factor: To use fixed xBRZ scale factor (i.e. to attune performance), set it to 2-6, 0 - use automatic calculation (default)
#   xbrz max scale factor: To cap maximum xBRZ scale factor used (i.e. to attune performance), set it to 2-6, 0 - use scaler allowed maximum (default)
#                 autofit: Best fits image to window
#                              Intended for output=direct3d, fullresolution=original, aspect=true
#          monochrome_pal: Specify the color of monochrome display.
#                            Append 'bright' for a brighter look.
#                            Possible values: green, amber, gray, white.

#             pc-98 timer master frequency: 8254 timer clock frequency (NEC PC-98). Depending on the CPU frequency the clock frequency is one of two common values.
#                                             If your setting is neither of the below the closest appropriate value will be chosen.
#                                             This setting affects the master clock rate that DOS applications must divide down from to program the timer
#                                             at the correct rate, which affects timer interrupt, PC speaker, and the COM1 RS-232C serial port baud rate.
#                                             8MHz is treated as an alias for 4MHz and 10MHz is treated as an alias for 5MHz.

#                     to display Japanese (jp), Chinese (chs/cht/cn/tw), or Korean (ko) text. Note that enabling DOS/V replaces 80x25 text mode with
#                     a EGA/VGA graphics mode that emulates text mode to display the characters and may be incompatible with non-Asian software that
#                     assumes direct access to the text mode via segment 0xB800. For a general DOS environment with CJK support please disable DOS/V
#                     emulation and use TrueType font (TTF) output with a CJK code page (932, 936, 949, 950) and TTF font with CJK characters instead.

#                                     lfb vmemdelay: Set this option to true if you need vmemdelay to apply to SVGA and linear framebuffer video modes as well.
#                                                      This affects anything in which DOSBox-X emulates as a linear framebuffer including MDA/Hercules and PC-98 LFB.
#                                                      Note that this option may slightly reduce emulator performance with such modes.
#                                   prevent capture: This option allows you to prevent capture of the DOSBox window, if an API is provided by the system to do so.
#                                                      empty or none: the window is normal and it can be screen captured.
#                                                      blank: notify the system so that if a screenshot is attempted, the window appears blank.
#                                                      invisible: notify the system not to include the DOSBox window in screen capture.

#                            vbe window granularity: Controls VESA BIOS non-linear framebuffer window granularity in KB. This affects ONLY the VESA BIOS extensions. Set 0 to functional normally.
#                                   vbe window size: Controls VESA BIOS non-linear framebuffer window size in KB. This affects ONLY the VESA BIOS extensions. Set 0 to functional normally.
#                                  enable 8-bit dac: If set, allow VESA BIOS calls in IBM PC mode to set DAC width. Has no effect in PC-98 mode.
#                           high intensity blinking: Set to false if you want to see high-intensity background colors instead of blinking foreground text.
#                                                      This option has no effect in PC-98 and some other video modes.

#                    enable supermegazeux tweakmode: If set, allow old MegaZeux 256-color text tweakmode aka 'Super MegaZeux mode'. Not all cards support this tweakmode.
#                                                      The ones that do are not emulated yet by DOSBox-X. It is not known at this time whether S3 chipsets support the hack.
#                                                      On normal cards the tweakmode does nothing but halve the text mode resolution without any other effects.

#                            vga bios size override: VGA BIOS size override. Override the size of the VGA BIOS (normally 32KB in compatible or 12KB in non-compatible).
# video bios dont duplicate cga first half rom font: If set, save 4KB of EGA/VGA ROM space by pointing to the copy in the ROM BIOS of the first 128 chars
#    video bios always offer 14-pixel high rom font: If set, video BIOS will always carry the 14-pixel ROM font. If clear, 14-pixel rom font will not be offered except for EGA/VGA emulation.
#    video bios always offer 16-pixel high rom font: If set, video BIOS will always carry the 16-pixel ROM font. If clear, 16-pixel rom font will not be offered except for VGA emulation.
#        video bios enable cga second half rom font: If set, and emulating CGA/PCjr/Tandy, automatically provide the second half of the 8x8 ROM font.
#                                                      This setting is ignored for EGA/VGA emulation. If not set, you will need a utility like GRAFTABL.COM to load the second half of the ROM font for graphics.
#                                                      NOTE: if you disable the 14 & 16 pixel high font AND the second half when machine=cga, you will disable video bios completely.
#                                         forcerate: Force the VGA framerate to a specific value(ntsc, pal, or specific hz), no matter what
#                                     sierra ramdac: Whether or not to emulate a Sierra or compatible RAMDAC at port 3C6h-3C9h.
#                                                      Some DOS games expect to access port 3C6h to enable highcolor/truecolor SVGA modes on older chipsets.
#                                                      Disable if you wish to emulate SVGA hardware that lacks a RAMDAC or (depending on the chipset) does
#                                                      not emulate a RAMDAC that is accessible through port 3C6h. This option has no effect for non-VGA video hardware.
#                            sierra ramdac lock 565: When emulating High Sierra highcolor RAMDAC, assume 5:6:5 at all times if set. Else,
#                                                      bit 6 of the DAC command selects between 5:5:5 and 5:6:5. Set this option for demos or
#                                                      games that got the command byte wrong (MFX Transgression 2) or any other demo that is
#                                                      not rendering highcolor 16bpp correctly.
#                            vga fill active memory: If set, DOSBox-X will fill inactive video memory regions with RAM rather than mapping them as empty. This allows the ETen Chinese DOS system (e.g. ET16V and ET24VA) to run.
#                              page flip debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC display offset registers were written.
#                                                      This can be used to help diagnose whether or not the DOS game is page flipping properly according to vertical retrace if the display on-screen is flickering.
#                  vertical retrace poll debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse green dotted line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC status port (0x3DA) was read.
#                                                      This can be used to help diagnose whether the DOS game is properly waiting for vertical retrace.
#                                           cgasnow: When machine=cga, determines whether or not to emulate CGA snow in 80x25 text mode.
#                                                      This parameter is also changeable from the builtin CGASNOW command in CGA mode.
#                            vga 3da undefined bits: VGA status port 3BA/3DAh only defines bits 0 and 3. This setting allows you to assign a bit pattern to the undefined bits.
#                                                      The purpose of this hack is to deal with demos that read and handle port 3DAh in ways that might crash if all are zero.
#                             rom bios 8x8 CGA font: If set, or mainline DOSBox compatible BIOS mapping, a legacy 8x8 CGA font (first 128 characters) is stored at 0xF000:0xFA6E. DOS programs that do not use INT 10h to locate fonts might require that font to be located there.
#                    rom bios video parameter table: If set, or mainline DOSBox compatible BIOS mapping, DOSBox-X will emulate the video parameter table and assign that to INT 1Dh. If clear, table will not be provided.
#                        int 10h points at vga bios: If set, INT 10h points at the VGA BIOS. If clear, INT 10h points into the system BIOS. This option only affects EGA/VGA/SVGA emulation.
#                                                      This option is needed for some older DOS applications that make additional checks before detecting EGA/VGA hardware (SuperCalc).
#                    unmask timer on int 10 setmode: If set, INT 10h will unmask IRQ 0 (timer) when setting video modes.
#              vesa bank switching window mirroring: If set, bank switch (windowed) VESA BIOS modes will ignore the window selection when asked
#                                                      to bank switch. Requests to control either Window A or Window B will succeed. This is needed
#                                                      for some demoscene productions with SVGA support that assume Window B is available, without
#                                                      which graphics do not render properly.
#                                                      If clear, Window B is presented as not available and attempts to use it will fail. Only Window A
#                                                      will be available, which is also DOSBox SVN behavior.
#            vesa bank switching window range check: Controls whether calls to bank switch (set the window number) through the VESA BIOS apply
#                                                      range checking. If set, out of range window numbers will return with an error code. This
#                                                      is also DOSBox SVN behavior. If clear, out of range window numbers are silently truncated
#                                                      to a number within range of available video memory and allowed to succeed.
#                                                      This is needed for some demoscene productions that rely on the silent truncation to render
#                                                      correctly without which drawing errors occur (e.g. end credits of Pill by Opiate)
#               vesa zero buffer on get information: This setting affects VESA BIOS function INT 10h AX=4F00h. If set, the VESA BIOS will zero the
#                                                      256-byte buffer defined by the standard at ES:DI, then fill in the structure. If clear, only
#                                                      the structure members will be filled in, and memory outside the initial 20-32 bytes will remain
#                                                      unmodified. This setting is ON by default. Some very early 1990s DOS games that support VESA
#                                                      BIOS standards may need this setting turned OFF if the programmer did not provide enough space
#                                                      for the entire 256 byte structure and the game crashes if it detects VESA BIOS extensions.
#                                                      Needed for:
#                                                        GETSADAM.EXE
#                            vesa set display vsync: Whether to wait for vertical retrace if VESA Set Display Address is used to pan the display.
#                                                      The default value -1 will wait if vesa_oldvbe, or not otherwise. 0 means not to wait.

#            vesa map non-lfb modes to 128kb region: If set, VESA BIOS SVGA modes will be set to map 128KB of video memory to A0000-BFFFF instead of
#                                                      64KB at A0000-AFFFF. This does not affect the SVGA window size or granularity.
#                                                      Some games or demoscene productions assume that they can render into the next SVGA window/bank

#                             ega per scanline hpel: If set, EGA emulation allows changing hpel per scanline. This is reportedly the behavior
#                                                      of IBM EGA hardware according to DOSBox SVN and on by default. If clear, EGA emulation
#                                                      latches hpel on vertical retrace end (like VGA does), which may have been EGA clone behavior

#                                                      This option affects only EGA emulation. To change VGA hpel behavior, use the 'allow hpel effects' setting instead.
#                                allow hpel effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to change the horizontal pel (panning) register per scanline.
#                                                      Some early DOS demos use this to create waving or sinus effects on the picture. Not very many VGA
#                                                      chipsets allow this, so far, only ATI chipsets are known to support this effect. Disabled by default.
#                            allow hretrace effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to make the picture wavy by playing with the 'start horizontalretrace' register of the CRTC during the active picture. Some early DOS demos (Copper by Surprise!productions) need this option set for some demo effects to work. Disabled by default.
#                            hretrace effect weight: If emulating hretrace effects, this parameter adds 'weight' to the offset to smooth it out.
#                                                      the larger the number, the more averaging is applied. This is intended to emulate the inertia

#                                 vesa modelist cap: IF nonzero, the VESA modelist is capped so that it contains no more than the specified number of video modes.
#                         vesa modelist width limit: IF nonzero, VESA modes with horizontal resolution higher than the specified pixel count will not be listed.
#                                                      This is another way the modelist can be capped for DOS applications that have trouble with long modelists.
#                        vesa modelist height limit: IF nonzero, VESA modes with vertical resolution higher than the specified pixel count will not be listed.
#                                                      This is another way the modelist can be capped for DOS applications that have trouble with long modelists.
#         vesa vbe put modelist in vesa information: If set, the VESA modelist is placed in the VESA information structure itself when the DOS application
#                                                      queries information on the VESA BIOS. Setting this option may help with some games, though it limits
#                                                      the mode list reported to the DOS application.
#                      vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp: If set, truecolor (16M color) VESA BIOS modes in the 0x100-0x11F range are 32bpp. If clear, they are 24bpp.
#                                                      Some DOS games and demos assume one bit depth or the other and do not enumerate VESA BIOS modes, which is why this
#                                                      option exists. If set to auto, this is determined by the type of SVGA chipset emulated.
#                                                      Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                   allow low resolution vesa modes: If set, allow low resolution VESA modes (320x200x16/24/32bpp and so on). You could set this to false to simulate
#                                                      SVGA hardware with a BIOS that does not support the lowres modes for testing purposes.
#                   allow explicit 24bpp vesa modes: If set, additional 24bpp modes are listed in the modelist regardless whether modes 0x100-0x11F are
#                                                      configured to be 24bpp or 32bpp. Setting this option can provide the best testing and development
#                                                      environment for new retro DOS code. If clear, 24bpp will only be available in the 0x100-0x11F range
#                                                      if the "vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp" is false. Setting to false helps to emulate typical SVGA
#                                                      hardware in which either 24bpp is supported, or 32bpp is supported, but not both. Disabled by default.
#                  allow high definition vesa modes: If set, offer HD video modes in the VESA modelist (such as 1280x720 aka 720p or 1920x1080 aka 1080p).
#                                                      This option also offers 4:3 versions (960x720 and 1440x1080) for DOS games that cannot properly handle
#                                                      a 16:9 aspect ratio, and several other HD modes. The modes enabled by this option are still limited by the
#                                                      width and height limits and available video memory.
#                                                      This is unusual for VESA BIOSes to do and is disabled by default.
#                          allow unusual vesa modes: If set, unusual (uncommon) modes are added to the list. The modes reflect uncommon resolutions
#                                                      added by external drivers (UNIVBE), some VESA BIOSes, some laptop and netbook displays, and
#                                                      some added by DOSBox-X for additional fun. Disabled by default.
#                            allow 32bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 32bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 24bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 24bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 16bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 16bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 15bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 15bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                             allow 8bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 8bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                             allow 4bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 4bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'.
#                                                      These modes have the same 16-color planar memory layout as standard VGA, but
#                                                      at SVGA resolution.
#                      allow 4bpp packed vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 4bpp packed VESA modes, set to 'false'.
#                                                      4bpp (16-color) packed is an unusual novelty mode only seen on specific Chips & Tech 65550
#                                                      VESA BIOSes such as the one in a Toshiba Libretto laptop. Disabled by default.
#                              allow tty vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with text VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                      double-buffered line compare: This setting affects the VGA Line Compare register. Set to false (default value) to emulate most VGA behavior
#                                                      Set to true for the value to latch once at the start of the frame.
#                          ignore vblank wraparound: DOSBox-X can handle active display properly if games or demos reprogram vertical blanking to end in the active picture area.
#                                                      If the wraparound handling prevents the game from displaying properly, set this to false. Out of bounds vblank values will be ignored.
#                                                      
#                        ignore extended memory bit: Some DOS applications use VGA 256-color mode but accidentally clear the extended memory
#                                                      bit originally defined to indicate whether EGA hardware has more than 64KB of RAM.
#                                                      Setting this option can correct for that. Needed for Mr. Blobby.
#                           enable vga resize delay: If the DOS game you are running relies on certain VGA raster tricks that affect active display area, enable this option.
#                                                      This adds a delay between VGA mode changes and window updates. It also means that if you are capturing a demo or game,
#                                                      that your capture will also show a few garbled frames at any point mode changes occur, which is why this option is disabled
#                                                      by default. If you intend to run certain DOS games and demos like DoWhackaDo, enable this option.
#  resize only on vga active display width increase: If set, changes to the Display End register of the CRTC do not trigger DOSBox-X to resize its window
#                                                      IF the value written is less than the current value. Some demos like DoWhackaDo need this option set
#                                                      because of the way its raster effects work. If the DOSBox-X window rapidly changes size during a demo
#                                                      try setting this option. Else, leave it turned off. Changes to other VGA CRTC registers will trigger
#                                                      a DOSBox-X mode change as normal regardless of this setting.
#                   vga palette update on full load: If set, all three bytes of the palette entry must be loaded before taking the color,
#                                                      which is fairly typical SVGA behavior. If not set, partial changes are allowed.
#             ignore odd-even mode in non-cga modes: Some demoscene productions use VGA Mode X but accidentally enable odd/even mode.
#                                                      Setting this option can correct for that and render the demo properly.
#                                                      This option forces VGA emulation to ignore odd/even mode except in text and CGA modes.
#                         ignore sequencer blanking: If set, ignore attempts to blank the display using the EGA/VGA sequencer registers.
#                                                      This should not be set except for DOS games with bugs in their display handling code.
#                          memory io optimization 1: Enable one class of EGA/VGA memory I/O optimizations. Default ON (true).
#                                                      If graphical artifacts or errors occur, try turning this off first. May provide a performance benefit.
#                         scanline render on demand: Render video output at vsync or when something is changed mid frame, instead of stopping to render every scanline.
#                                                      May provide a performance benefit to most DOS games. However this may also break timing-dependent game or Demoscene effects.

#                                                    This can for example be used to return DOSBox-X's current status and by the guest OS to match the mouse pointer position.
#                          integration device pnp: List DOSBox-X integration I/O device as part of ISA PnP enumeration. This has no purpose yet.
#                                      isapnpbios: Emulate ISA Plug & Play BIOS. Enable if using DOSBox-X to run a PnP aware DOS program or if booting Windows 9x.
#                                                    Do not disable if Windows 9x is configured around PnP devices, you will likely confuse it.
#                                      isapnpport: Emulate ISA Plug & Play I/O ports, which are separate from the PnP BIOS.
#                                                    ISA Plug & Play devices provide these I/O ports as the means to determine hardware and configure resources.
#                                                    By default, this setting is 'auto' which enables the PnP I/O ports only if you enable the PnP BIOS.
#                                                    Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                                       realbig16: Allow the B (big) bit in real mode. If set, allow the DOS program to set the B bit,
#                                                    then jump to realmode with B still set (aka Huge Unreal mode). Needed for Project Angel.

[ttf]
#          font: Specifies a TrueType font to use for the TTF output. If not specified, the built-in TrueType font will be used.
#                  Either a font name or full font path can be specified. If file ends with the .TTF extension then the extension can be omitted.
#                  For a font name or relative path, directories such as the working directory and default system font directory will be searched.
#                  For example, setting it to "consola" or "consola.ttf" will use Consola font (included in Windows); similar for other TTF fonts.
#                  Additionally, OTF fonts (e.g. OratorStd.otf), .FON fonts (e.g. vgasys.fon), and .TTC fonts (e.g. msgothic.ttc) are also supported.
#                  To display Chinese/Japanese/Korean text in these code pages, a font with CJK characters is needed (e.g. GNU Unifont or Sarasa Gothic).
#      fontbold: You can optionally specify a bold TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the bold text style.
#                  It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual bold font will be used for the bold style.
#                  For example, setting it to "consolab" or "consolab.ttf" will use the Consolab font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#      fontital: You can optionally specify an italic TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the italic text style.
#                  It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual italic font will be used for the italic style.
#                  For example, setting it to "consolai" or "consolai.ttf" will use the Consolai font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#      fontboit: You can optionally specify a bold italic TrueType font for use with the TTF output that will render the bold italic text style.
#                  It requires a word processor be set with the wp option, and this actual bold-italic font will be used for the bold-italic style.
#                  For example, setting it to "consolaz" or "consolaz.ttf" will use the Consolaz font; similar for other TTF fonts.
#        colors: Specifies a color scheme to use for the TTF output by supply all 16 color values in RGB: (r,g,b) or hexadecimal as in HTML: #RRGGBB
#                  The original DOS colors (0-15): #000000 #0000aa #00aa00 #00aaaa #aa0000 #aa00aa #aa5500 #aaaaaa #555555 #5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 #ffffff
#                  gray scaled color scheme: (0,0,0)  #0e0e0e  (75,75,75) (89,89,89) (38,38,38) (52,52,52) #717171 #c0c0c0 #808080 (28,28,28) (150,150,150) (178,178,178) (76,76,76) (104,104,104) (226,226,226) (255,255,255)
#                  An optional leading "+" sign allows the preset color scheme to be used when switching from another output.
#  outputswitch: Specifies the output that DOSBox-X should switch to from the TTF output when a graphical mode is requested, or auto for automatic selection.
#                  Possible values: auto, surface, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, direct3d.
#       winperc: Specifies the window percentage for the TTF output (100 = full screen). Ignored if the ptsize setting is specified.
#        ptsize: Specifies the font point size for the TTF output. If specified (minimum: 9), it will override the winperc setting.
#          lins: Specifies the number of rows on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#          cols: Specifies the number of columns on the screen for the TTF output (0 = default).
#   righttoleft: If set, DOSBox-X will display text from right to left instead of left to right on the screen for the TTF output.
#                  This is especially useful for languages which use right-to-left scripts (such as Arabic and Hebrew).
#            wp: You can specify a word processor for the TTF output and optionally also a version number for the word processor.
#                  Supported word processors are WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite, FE=FastEdit, and an optional version number.
#                  For example, WP6 will set the word processor as WordPerfect 6, and XY4 will set the word processor as XyWrite 4.
#                  Word processor-specific features like on-screen text styles and 512-character font will be enabled based on this.
#          wpbg: You can optionally specify a color to match the background color of the specified word processor for the TTF output.
#                  Use the DOS color number (0-15: 0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Green, 3=Cyan, 4=Red, 5=Magenta, 6=Yellow, 7=White, etc) for this.
#          wpfg: You can optionally specify a color to match the foreground color of the specified word processor for the TTF output.
#                  Use the DOS color number (0-7: 0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Green, 3=Cyan, 4=Red, 5=Magenta, 6=Yellow, 7=White) for this.
#          bold: If set, DOSBox-X will display bold text in visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#                  This is done either with the actual bold font specified by the fontbold option, or by making it bold automatically.
#        italic: If set, DOSBox-X will display italicized text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#                  This is done either with the actual italic font specified by the fontital option, or by slanting the characters automatically.
#     underline: If set, DOSBox-X will display underlined text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#     strikeout: If set, DOSBox-X will display strikeout text visually (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#       char512: If set, DOSBox-X will display the 512-character font if possible (requires a word processor be set) for the TTF output.
#     printfont: If set, DOSBox-X will force to use the current TrueType font (set via font option) for printing in addition to displaying.
#      autodbcs: If set, DOSBox-X enables Chinese/Japanese/Korean DBCS (double-byte) characters when these code pages are active by default.
#                  Only applicable when using a DBCS code page (932: Japanese, 936: Simplified Chinese; 949: Korean; 950: Traditional Chinese)
#                  This applies to both the display and printing of these characters (see the [printer] section for details of the latter).
#   autoboxdraw: If set, DOSBox-X will auto-detect ASCII box-drawing characters for CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) support in the TTF output.
#                  Only applicable when using a DBCS code page (932: Japanese, 936: Simplified Chinese; 949: Korean; 950: Traditional Chinese)
#                  This applies to both the display and printing of these characters (see the [printer] section for details of the latter).
# halfwidthkana: If set, DOSBox-X enables half-width Katakana to replace upper ASCII characters for the Japanese code page (932) of a non-PC98 machine type in the TTF output.
#        blinkc: If set to true, the cursor blinks for the TTF output; setting it to false will turn the blinking off.
#                  You can also change the blinking rate by setting an integer between 1 (fastest) and 7 (slowest), or 0 for no cursor.
#           gbk: Enables the GBK extension (in addition to the standard GB2312 charset) for the Simplified Chinese TTF output or DOS/V emulation.
#      chinasea: Enables the ChinaSea and Big5-2003 extension (in addition to the standard Big5-1984 charset) for the Traditional Chinese TTF output.
#                  A TTF/OTF font containing such characters (such as the included SarasaGothicFixed TTF font) is needed to correctly render ChinaSea characters.
#           uao: Enables the Big5 Unicode-At-On (UAO) extension instead of the Big5 HKSCS extension for the hidden code page 951 of the Traditional Chinese TTF output.
#      dosvfunc: If set, enables FEP control to function for Japanese DOS/V applications, and changes the blinking of character attributes to high brightness.

#         roland gs sysex: Listen for and handle some Roland GS System Exclusive messages, such as GS Reset and Master Volume.
#                            This is needed for PC-98 games that have hanging/stuck MIDI note problems because they rely on these
#                            messages to reset the synth rather than using standard MIDI commands.
#                  mpu401: Type of MPU-401 to emulate.

#                            When using a Roland MT-32 rev. 0 as midi output device, some games may require a delay in order to prevent 'buffer overflow' issues.
#                            In that case, add 'delaysysex', for example: midiconfig=2 delaysysex
#                            See the README/Manual for more details.
#              samplerate: Sample rate for MIDI synthesizer, if applicable.

#             mt32.romdir: Name of the directory where MT-32 Control and PCM ROM files can be found. Emulation requires these files to work.
#                              Accepted file names are as follows:
#                                MT32_CONTROL.ROM or CM32L_CONTROL.ROM - control ROM file.
#                                MT32_PCM.ROM or CM32L_PCM.ROM - PCM ROM file.
#              mt32.model: Model of the MT-32 synthesizer to use.
#                            Possible values: cm32l, mt32, auto.

#             mt32.thread: MT-32 rendering in separate thread
#              mt32.chunk: Minimum milliseconds of data to render at once. (min 2, max 100)
#                            Increasing this value reduces rendering overhead which may improve performance but also increases audio lag.
#                            Valid for rendering in separate thread only.
#                            Possible values: 2, 3, 16, 99, 100.

#                            Cannot be set less than or equal to mt32.chunk value.
#                            Valid for rendering in separate thread only.

#                            Produces samples at double the volume, without tricks.
#                            Higher quality than the real devices
#

#                            Produces samples that exactly match the bits output from the emulated LA32.
#                            Nicer overdrive characteristics than the DAC hacks (it simply clips samples within range)
#                            Much less likely to overdrive than any other mode.
#                            Half the volume of any of the other modes, meaning its volume relative to the reverb
#                            output when mixed together directly will sound wrong. So, reverb level must be lowered.
#                            Perfect for developers while debugging :)

#                            
#                            Coarse = 1
#                            Coarse emulation of LPF circuit. High frequencies are boosted, sample rate remains unchanged.
#                            A bit better sounding but also a bit slower.
#                            
#                            Accurate = 2 - default
#                            Finer emulation of LPF circuit. Output signal is upsampled to 48 kHz to allow emulation of audible mirror spectra above 16 kHz,
#                            which is passed through the LPF circuit without significant attenuation.
#                            Sounding is closer to the analog output from real hardware but also slower than the modes 0 and 1.
#                            
#                            Oversampled = 3
#                            Same as the default mode 2 but the output signal is 2x oversampled, i.e. the output sample rate is 96 kHz.
#                            Even slower than all the other modes but better retains highest frequencies while further resampled in DOSBox-X mixer.
#                            Possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3.
#        mt32.output.gain: Output gain of MT-32 emulation in percent, 100 is the default value, the allowed maximum is 1000.
#        mt32.reverb.mode: MT-32 reverb mode
#                            Possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3, auto.

#               mt32.rate: Sample rate of MT-32 emulation.
#                            Possible values: 49716, 48000, 44100, 32000, 22050, 16000, 11025, 8000.
#        mt32.src.quality: MT-32 sample rate conversion quality
#                            Value '0' is for the fastest conversion, value '3' provides for the best conversion quality. Default is 2.
#                            Possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3.
#        mt32.niceampramp: Toggles "Nice Amp Ramp" mode that improves amplitude ramp for sustaining instruments.
#                            Quick changes of volume or expression on a MIDI channel may result in amp jumps on real hardware.
#                            When "Nice Amp Ramp" mode is enabled (default), amp changes gradually instead.
#                            Otherwise, the emulation accuracy is preserved.
#    mt32.engage.channel1: Use alternative channel assignment on synth start.
#                            By default, MT-32 compatible devices only react on MIDI messages that come on MIDI channels 2-10 ignoring messages
#                            on MIDI channel 1. However, some tunes involve MIDI channel 1 yet do not initialise the device accordingly.
#                            In such cases, one might fix this by pressing a magic button combination on MT-32 front panel.
#                            Enabling this property has the same effect: the device starts recognising messages on MIDI channels 1-8 and 10 instead.
#                            Default is false.
#            fluid.driver: Driver to use with Fluidsynth, not needed under Windows. Available drivers depend on what Fluidsynth was compiled with.

[gus]
#                                gus: Enable the Gravis Ultrasound emulation.
#         global register read alias: If true, all GUS global registers have a read alias at N and N+0x80.
#                                       If false, only the voice registers 0x0-0xF have a read alias at 0x80-0x8F as officially documented.
#                                       If auto, automatically choose based on other settings such as GUS type.
#                                       This setting may be needed for DOS demoscene entries that assume aliasing behavior such as Out of Control by Contract.
#                                       Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#  warn on out of bounds dram access: Controls whether attempts to access GUS DRAM beyond the 1MB maximum supported by the card are logged to the log file as a warning.
#                            autoamp: If set, GF1 output will reduce in volume automatically if the sum of all channels exceeds full volume.
#                                       If not set, then loud music will clip to full volume just as it would on real hardware.
#                                       Enable this option for loud music if you want a more pleasing rendition without saturation and distortion.
#                         unmask dma: Start the DOS virtual machine with the DMA channel already unmasked at the controller.
#                                       Use this for DOS applications that expect to operate the GUS but forget to unmask the DMA channel.
#  ignore channel count while active: Ignore writes to the active channel count register when the DAC is enabled (bit 1 of GUS reset)
#                                       This is a HACK for demoscene prod 'Ice Fever' without which the music sounds wrong.
#                                       According to current testing real hardware does not behave this way.
#                     pic unmask irq: Start the DOS virtual machine with the GUS IRQ already unmasked at the PIC.
#                startup initialized: If set, start the GF1 in a fully initialized state (as if ULTRINIT had been run).
#                                       If clear, leave the card in an uninitialized state (as if cold boot).
#                                       Some DOS games or demoscene productions will hang or fail to use the Ultrasound hardware
#                                       because they assume the card is initialized and their hardware detect does not fully initialize the card.
#  dma enable on dma control polling: If set, automatically enable GUS DMA transfer bit in specific cases when the DMA control register is being polled.
#                                       THIS IS A HACK. Some games and demoscene productions need this hack to avoid hanging while uploading sample data
#                                       to the Gravis Ultrasound due to bugs in their implementation.
# clear dma tc irq if excess polling: If the DOS application is seen polling the IRQ status register rapidly, automatically clear the DMA TC IRQ status.
#                                       This is a hack that should only be used with DOS applications that need it to avoid bugs in their GUS support code.
#                                       Needed for:
#                                         Warcraft II by Blizzard ............. if using GUS for music and sound, set this option to prevent the game from

#            force master irq enable: Set this option if a DOS game or demo initializes the GUS but is unable to play any music.
#                                       Usually the cause is buggy GUS support that resets the GUS but fails to set the Master IRQ enable bit.
#                  gus panning table: Controls which table or equation is used for the Gravis Ultrasound panning emulation.
#                                       accurate emulation attempts to better reflect how the actual hardware handles panning,
#                                       while the old emulation uses a simpler idealistic mapping.
#                                       Possible values: old, accurate, default.
#                            gusrate: Sample rate of Ultrasound emulation.

#              gus fixed render rate: If set, Gravis Ultrasound audio output is rendered at a fixed sample rate specified by 'gusrate'. This can provide better quality than real hardware,
#                                       if desired. Else, Gravis Ultrasound emulation will change the sample rate of its output according to the number of active channels, just like real hardware.
#                                       Note: DOSBox-X defaults to 'false', while mainline DOSBox SVN is currently hardcoded to render as if this setting is 'true'.

#                  gus master volume: Master Gravis Ultrasound GF1 volume, in decibels. Reducing the master volume can help with games or demoscene productions where the music is too loud and clipping.

#                                              xms: Enable XMS support.
#      turn off a20 gate on load if loadfix needed: If enabled, and loading a program below the 64kb boundary, turn off the A20 gate.
#                                                     This can help with any program with startup code that assumes the segment wraparound of the 8086.
#                                                     Depending on DOS configuration the A20 gate may be re-enabled later such as calling INT 21h.
#                xms memmove causes flat real mode: If set, any call to XMS to move/copy memory sets up flat real mode for segment registers DS and ES.
#                   xms init causes flat real mode: If set, when the DOS kernel initializes XMS it will switch on flat real mode for segment registers DS and ES if appropriate.
#      resized free memory block becomes allocated: If set, and the DOS application resizes a freed memory block, that block will be marked as allocated to that program.
#                                                     MS-DOS behaves in this manner, apparently.
#                                      xms handles: Number of XMS handles available for the DOS environment, or 0 to use a reasonable default
#                  shell configuration as commands: Allow entering dosbox-x.conf configuration parameters as shell commands to get and set settings.
#                                                     This is disabled by default to avoid conflicts between commands and executables.
#                                                     It is recommended to get and set dosbox-x.conf settings using the CONFIG command instead.
#                                                     Compatibility with DOSBox SVN can be improved by enabling this option.
#                                badcommandhandler: Allow to specify a custom error handler command for the internal DOS shell before the "Bad command or file name" message shows up.
#                               mscdex device name: If set, use this name as the MSCDEX device name instead of MSCD001
#                                              hma: Report through XMS that HMA exists (not necessarily available)
#                            hma allow reservation: Allow TSR and application (anything other than the DOS kernel) to request control of the HMA.
#                                                     They will not be able to request control however if the DOS kernel is configured to occupy the HMA (DOS=HIGH)
#              command shell flush keyboard buffer: If set, the DOS shell (COMMAND.COM) will flush the keyboard buffer before executing a command, and will flush the keyboard buffer again when the command returns.
#                                                     The purpose of this option is to prevent the program from immediately acting on the Enter key you pressed to run it.
#                       hard drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) hard disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                                     Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 (default) to use a reasonable limit.
#                                                     The disk I/O performance as in DOSBox SVN can be achieved by setting this to 0.
#                     floppy drive data rate limit: Slow down (limit) floppy disk throughput. This setting controls the limit in bytes/second.
#                                                     Set to 0 to disable the limit, or -1 (default) to use a reasonable limit.
#                                                     The disk I/O performance as in DOSBox SVN can be achieved by setting this to 0.
#                    special operation file prefix: The file prefix used by DOSBox-X's special operations on mounted local/overlay drives. It is fixed to "DB" in mainline DOSBox.
#                                drive z is remote: If set, DOS will report drive Z as remote. If not set, DOS will report drive Z as local.
#                                                     If auto (default), DOS will report drive Z as remote or local depending on the program.
#                                                     Set this option to true to prevent SCANDISK.EXE from attempting scan and repair drive Z:
#                                                     which is impossible since Z: is a virtual drive not backed by a disk filesystem.

#                              drive z convert fat: If set, DOSBox-X will automatically convert the Z drive into disk image as well when "convertdrivefat" is set.
#                              drive z expand path: If set, DOSBox-X will automatically expand the %PATH% environment variable to include the subdirectories on the Z drive.
#                               drive z hide files: The files or directories listed here (separated by space) will be either hidden or removed from the Z drive.
#                                                     Files with leading forward slashes (e.g. "/DEBUG\BIOSTEST.COM") will become hidden files (DIR /A will list them).
#                      automount drive directories: If set, DOSBox-X will automatically mount existing drive directories from C drive to Y drive, e.g. "DriveC".
#                                                     NOTE: This option is only available under Windows.
#                             hidenonrepresentable: If set, DOSBox-X will hide files on local drives that are non-representative in the current DOS code page.
#                                                     This may be required for some programs such as Windows 3.x Setup if the drives contain international filenames.
#                           hma minimum allocation: Minimum allocation size for HMA in bytes (equivalent to /HMAMIN= parameter).
#                                         ansi.sys: If set (by default), ANSI.SYS emulation is on. If clear, ANSI.SYS is not emulated and will not appear to be installed.
#                                                     NOTE: This option has no effect in PC-98 mode where MS-DOS systems integrate ANSI.SYS into the DOS kernel.
#                                      log console: If set, log DOS CON output to the log file. Setting to "quiet" will log DOS CON output only (no debugging output).
#                                                     Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, quiet.
#                                     dos sda size: SDA (swappable data area) size, in bytes. Set to 0 to use a reasonable default.
#                                   hma free space: Controls the amount of free space available in HMA. This setting is not meaningful unless the
#                                                     DOS kernel occupies HMA and the emulated DOS version is at least 5.0.
#                           cpm compatibility mode: This controls how the DOS kernel sets up the CP/M compatibility code in the PSP segment.
#                                                     Several options are provided to emulate one of several undocumented behaviors related to the CP/M entry point.
#                                                     If set to auto, DOSBox-X will pick the best option to allow it to work properly.
#                                                     Unless set to 'off', this option will require the DOS kernel to occupy the first 256 bytes of the HMA memory area
#                                                     to prevent crashes when the A20 gate is switched on.
#                                                        auto      Pick the best option
#                                                        off       Turn off the CP/M entry point (program will abort if called)
#                                                        msdos2    MS-DOS 2.x behavior, offset field also doubles as data segment size
#                                                        msdos5    MS-DOS 5.x behavior, entry point becomes one of two fixed addresses
#                                                        direct    Non-standard behavior, encode the CALL FAR directly to the entry point rather than indirectly
#                                                     Possible values: auto, off, msdos2, msdos5, direct.
#                                            share: Reports SHARE.EXE as resident and provides functions such as file-locking and record-locking, although not all SHARE functions are emulated.
#                                file access tries: If a positive integer is set, DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock files directly on mounted local drives for the specified number of times without caching before failing on Windows systems.
#                                                     For networked database applications (e.g. dBase, FoxPro, etc), it is strongly recommended to set this to e.g. 3 for correct operations.
#                               network redirector: Report DOS network redirector as resident. This will allow the host name to be returned unless the secure mode is enabled.
#                                                     You can also directly access UNC network paths in the form \\MACHINE\SHARE even if they are not mounted as drives on Windows systems.
#                                                     Set either "ipx=true" in [ipx] section or "ne2000=true" in [ne2000] section for a full network redirector environment.
#              minimum dos initial private segment: In non-mainline mapping mode, where DOS structures are allocated from base memory, this sets the
#                                                     minimum segment value. Recommended value is 0x70. You may reduce the value down to 0x50 if freeing
#                                                     up more memory is important. Set to 0 for default.
#                              minimum mcb segment: Minimum segment value to begin memory allocation from, in hexadecimal. Set to 0 for default.
#                                                     You can increase available DOS memory by reducing this value down to as low as 0x51, however
#                                                     setting it to low can cause some DOS programs to crash or run erratically, and some DOS games
#                                                     and demos to cause intermittent static noises when using Sound Blaster output. DOS programs
#                                                     compressed with Microsoft EXEPACK will not run if the minimum MCB segment is below 64KB. This differs
#                                                     from 'minimum mcb free' in that this affects the starting point of the mcb chain instead of the lowest free block.
#                                 minimum mcb free: Minimum free segment value to leave free. At startup, the DOS kernel will allocate memory
#                                                     up to this point. This can be used to deal with EXEPACK issues or DOS programs that cannot
#                                                     be loaded too low in memory. If you want more free conventional memory to be reported,
#                                                     you can for example set its value to 1.
#                          enable dummy device mcb: If set (default), allocate a fake device MCB at the base of conventional memory.
#                                                     Clearing this option can reclaim a small amount of conventional memory at the expense of
#                                                     some minor DOS compatibility.
#           maximum environment block size on exec: Maximum environment block size to copy for child processes. Set to -1 for default.
#        additional environment block size on exec: When executing a program, compute the size of the parent block then add this amount to allow for a few additional variables.
#                                                     If the subprocesses will never add/modify the environment block, you can free up a few additional bytes by setting this to 0.
#                                                     Set to -1 for default setting.
#                       enable a20 on windows init: If set, DOSBox-X will enable the A20 gate when Windows 3.1/9x broadcasts the INIT message
#                                                     at startup. Windows 3.1 appears to make assumptions at some key points on startup about
#                                                     A20 that don't quite hold up and cause Windows 3.1 to crash when you set A20 emulation
#                                                     to a20=mask as opposed to a20=fast. This option is enabled by default.
#             zero memory on xms memory allocation: If set, memory returned by XMS allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                     DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
#                                                     related to uninitialized variables in extended memory. When enabled this option may
#                                                     incur a slight to moderate performance penalty.
#                                              ems: Enable EMS support. The default (=true) provides the best
#                                                     compatibility but certain applications may run better with
#                                                     other choices, or require EMS support to be disabled (=false)
#                                                     to work at all.
#                                                     Possible values: true, emsboard, emm386, false, 1, 0.
#                                             vcpi: If set and expanded memory is enabled, also emulate VCPI.
#                          unmask timer on disk io: If set, INT 21h emulation will unmask IRQ 0 (timer interrupt) when the application opens/closes/reads/writes files.
#                           zero int 67h if no ems: If ems=false, leave interrupt vector 67h zeroed out (default true).
#                                                     This is a workaround for games or demos that try to detect EMS by whether or not INT 67h is 0000:0000 rather than a proper test.
#                                                     This option also affects whether INT 67h is zeroed when booting a guest OS.
#                              zero unused int 68h: Leave INT 68h zero at startup.
#                                                     Set this to true for certain games that use INT 68h in unusual ways that require a zero value.
#                                                     Note that the vector is left at zero anyway when machine=cga.
#                                                     This is needed to properly run 1988 game 'PopCorn'.
#                            emm386 startup active: If set and expanded memory is set to emulate emm386, start the DOS machine with EMM386.EXE active
#                                                     (running the 16-bit DOS environment from within Virtual 8086 mode). If you will be running anything
#                                                     that involves a DOS extender you will also need to enable the VCPI interface as well.
#             zero memory on ems memory allocation: If set, memory returned by EMS allocation call is zeroed first. This is NOT what
#                                                     DOS actually does, but if set, can help certain DOS games and demos cope with problems
#                                                     related to uninitialized variables in expanded memory. When enabled this option may
#                                                     incur a slight to moderate performance penalty.
#                    ems system handle memory size: Amount of memory associated with system handle, in KB.
#               ems system handle on even megabyte: If set, try to allocate the EMM system handle on an even megabyte.
#                                                     If the DOS game or demo fiddles with the A20 gate while using EMM386.EXE emulation in virtual 8086 mode, setting this option may help prevent crashes.
#                                                     However, forcing allocation on an even megabyte will also cause some extended memory fragmentation and reduce the
#                                                     overall amount of extended memory available to the DOS game depending on whether it expects large contiguous chunks
#                                                     of extended memory.
#                                        ems frame: Segment of the EMS page frame, if set. C000, D000, or E000
#                                              umb: Enable UMB support.
#                                        umb start: UMB region starting segment
#                                          umb end: UMB region last segment
#                         kernel allocation in umb: If set, dynamic kernel allocation=1, and private area in umb=1, all kernel structures will be allocated from the private area in UMB.
#                                                     If you intend to run Windows 3.1 in DOSBox-X, you must set this option to false else Windows 3.1 will not start.
#                                 keep umb on boot: If emulating UMBs, keep the UMB around after boot (Mainline DOSBox behavior). If clear, UMB is unmapped when you boot an operating system.
#                        keep private area on boot: If set to true, keep the DOSBox-X private area around after boot (Mainline DOSBox behavior). If false, unmap and discard the private area when you boot an operating system.
#                                                     If set to auto, DOSBox-X will unmap and discard the private area while booting to a guest system unless Glide passthrough is enabled (useful for Windows 9x Glide support).
#                                                     
#                                                     Possible values: true, false, 1, 0, auto.
#                              private area in umb: If set, keep private DOS segment in upper memory block, usually segment 0xC800 (Mainline DOSBox behavior)
#                                                     If clear, place private DOS segment at the base of system memory (just below the MCB)
#                       private area write protect: If set, prevent the guest from writing to the DOSBox private area. The emulator itself can still write to it, of course.
#                                                     Some DOS games have sloppy video routines that can spill over and corrupt the private area and cause problems.
#                                                     This option when set can prevent that errant game from causing crashes.
#                                     quick reboot: If set, the DOS restart call will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated DOS or guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine.
#                                                     
#                                              ver: Set DOS version. Specify as major.minor format. A single number is treated as the major version (compatible with LFN support). Common settings are:
#                                                     auto (or unset)                  Pick DOS kernel version 5.0 (DOSBox default)
#                                                     3.3                              MS-DOS 3.3 emulation (not tested!)

#                                                     Long filename (LFN) support will be enabled with a reported DOS version of 7.0 or higher with "lfn=auto" (default).
#                                                     Similarly, FAT32 disk images will be supported with a reported DOS version of 7.1 or higher.

#       ipv4_dhcp_start: The start address used for DHCP by the host services on the IPv4 network.
#     tcp_port_forwards: Forwards one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
#                          The format is:
#                            port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
#                            This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
#                          If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
#                            host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
#                            This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest
#                          A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
#                            start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
#                            This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
#                          Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
#                            hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
#                            This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest
#                          Notes:
#                            - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
#                            - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
#                            - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
#     udp_port_forwards: Forwards one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
#                          The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.

#                                    Normally, floppy controllers use IRQ 6.
#                     io: Base I/O port for floppy controller. Set to 0 for default.
#                           WARNING: Setting the I/O port to non-standard values will not work unless the guest OS is using the ISA PnP BIOS to detect the IDE controller.
#                                    Standard I/O ports are 3F0 and 370.
#                    dma: DMA channel for floppy controller. Set to -1 for default.
#                           WARNING: Setting the DMA channel to non-standard values will not work unless the guest OS is using the ISA PnP BIOS to detect the IDE controller.
#                                    Standard DMA channel is 2.
#         int13fakev86io: If set, certain INT 13h commands will cause floppy emulation to issue fake CPU I/O
#                           traps (GPF) in virtual 8086 mode and a fake IRQ signal. You must enable this
#                           option if you want 32-bit floppy access in Windows 95 to work with DOSBox-X.
#           instant mode: If set, all floppy operations are 'instantaneous', they are carried
#                           out without any delay. Real hardware of course has motor, command
#                           and data I/O delays and so this option is off by default for realistic
#                           emulation.
# auto-attach to int 13h: If set, DOSBox-X will automatically attach a disk image as being
#                           inserted into a floppy drive attached to the controller when imgmount is used
#                           to mount a disk image to drive 0/1 or A/B. If not set, you must specify
#                           the -fdc option to imgmount to attach drive A/B to the floppy controller
#                           manually. You must use the -fdc option regardless if loading floppies into
#                           drives attached to any other FDC than the primary controller
