DOSBox-X supports many internal or external MS-DOS commands. Also, DOSBox-X offers additional commands such as BOOT, MOUNT and RESCAN, which are not found in MS-DOS or compatibles.

It can also be used to rearrange VESA BIOS modes for retro developers who want to make sure their code works properly no matter what strange VESA BIOS their code runs into on real hardware.

It can also be used for development and testing to simulate a PC whose refresh rate is locked in hardware, such as what happens when running a DOS program on laptops. Even though standard VGA is 60Hz or 70Hz, laptops will lock the refresh rate to 60Hz when sending video to the internal display.

+
Usage: NMITEST
+
Note: This will test if the interrupt handler works properly.

Note: As of DOSBox-X version 0.83.6, you can customize the external commands as appeared on the Z: drive. For example, you can add your favorite DOS programs to the drivez directory, which will add to or replace existing programs on the Z: drive.
