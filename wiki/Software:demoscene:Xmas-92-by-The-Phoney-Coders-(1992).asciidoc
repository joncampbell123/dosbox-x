Demo description
----------------

(todo)

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=vgaonly
memsize=1

[cpu]
cycles=12000
core=normal
cputype=pentium

[midi]
mpu401=intelligent

# By default DOSBox-X should choose your system MIDI configuration.
# If you just want to use FluidSynth on Linux like I do:
mididevice=synth
midiconfig=/usr/share/fluidsynth/soundfont/gengs.sf2
....

To run the demo type LOADER.EXE.

MIDI playback speed issues with DOSBox-X
----------------------------------------

At this time the demo seems to have problems maintaining a consistent
speed when playing back the music. It seems to be related to whether or
not the demo can maintain a full frame rate when drawing, and whether
VGA scrolling/panning is involved.

MPU-401 issues
--------------

As of 2015/12/18 the demo appears to reset the MPU401 interface several
times, then crash back to DOS. Something broke MIDI output in recent
commits.
