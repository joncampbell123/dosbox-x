"Dope" demo bugs (DOSBox-X's fault)

BUG: Noticeable pause of music at points where VGA BIOS is called to set video mode during demo

BUG: You can only run the demo once. Additional attempts log "illegal instruction" messages and
     crash back to the DOS prompt. You must close and reopen DOSBox-X to run the demo again.

 - I know for a fact that is not a feature of the demo. Having run it on real hardware, I know
   the demo can be run again after the first time (though it is not reliable at reinitializing
   the GUS to a known state).

 - The debug messages from DOSBox-X are:
