Impact Studio - Legends

* NOTE: There used to be bugs below, but they have been fixed.
        This file is now a list of the oddities found in the demo.

------------
Problem: Two parts of the demo, a rotating 3D dot object, does not
         render properly and it becomes a large flickering ball on
         the screen.

Fix: The demo is using a combination of using the bitmask in the
     grapics controller (register 8) and "bitplane flipping" using
     the VGA DAC pel mask (0x3C6) to draw the objects. It hides the
     "bitplane" using the Pel mask register, then sets the bitmask
     in the graphics controller so that when it draws the object,
     only one bit in each 8-bit pixel is changed.

     Prior to the fix, DOSBox's VGA emulation did not support using
     the graphics controller bitmask or ROP modes in chained VGA
     320x200x256 mode.

------------
Problem: Demo runs at half speed, malfunctions at some point and
         gets stuck at the two reflective moving balls until music
         loops around again.

Workaround: The PIT hack "pc_speaker_as_timer" is still in the DOSBox-X
            source code if this problem resurfaces. At this time, the
            problem seems to have fixed itself and the demo runs
            perfectly fine.
