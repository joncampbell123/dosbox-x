- Bochs VBE extensions are easy to program: you access a fixed I/O port and
  communicate through it to talk to Bochs. Write a proof-of-concept program
  in DOSLIB.
- Add I/O handler to emulate basic Bochs VBE communication.
- Add code so that it is possible to change VGA modes through it, just like
  in Bochs and VirtualBox
- Add code to emulate or fake other settings you can change through it.
- Add setting in dosbox.conf that allows user to enable/disable this emulation.
  The setting should be disabled by default, since this emulation is irrelevent
  to DOS gaming but potentially useful for running Windows 3.1/95 (because I
  can then code up a simple linear framebuffer that uses the interface to do
  modesetting!). Don't code the setting as a boolean, code it as a multivalue
  to choose between "off", "bochsvbe", "virtualbox", etc.
- Add basic VirtualBox 4.x OMAPI emulation
- Add additional sequence by which DOSBox can be recognized through the
  interface, and DOSBox-specific settings can be programmed. The DOSBox
  extensions should also be enabled/disabled by a setting in dosbox.conf.
