[1] The DOS VM is able to draw the mode windowed correctly,
    but the S3 driver doesn't seem to switch it back to fullscreen
    properly.

* NTS: Windows 3.1 will not  show the DOS screen windowed for 320x200x256
       color (mode 19) for some reason.

       Despite that, the DOS VM is able to restore the mode correctly
       going back to fullscreen.

Windows 95:

[1] The DOS VM is able to draw the mode windowed correctly,
    but the driver doesn't seem to switch it back to fullscreen
    properly.

Windows 3.1:

The ET4000 driver in the test VM seems to mistake all
modes 4-6 and 13-18 as some variant of 256-color mode
for some weird reason, the graphics are drawn as
"squeezed". And for some reason, the DOS VM refuses to
run 320x200x256-color mode windowed, which is strange,
I remember running that mode just fine on my ancient
386...

* NTS: Windows 3.1's standard VGA driver (640x480x16 mode) will not
       show the DOS screen windowed for 320x200x256 color (mode 19)
       obviously because that would require the DOS VM window to
       create a color palette and map it somehow to 16 colors.

       But... for some reason, 320x200x256 mode X is OK to run
       windowed, even if it allows the general palette on screen
       to get messed up doing so. Weird.

       Despite that, the DOS VM is able to restore the mode correctly
       going back to fullscreen.
