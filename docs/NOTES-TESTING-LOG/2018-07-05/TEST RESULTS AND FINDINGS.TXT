2018/07/02 test results and findings.

Test units:

COMP-IBMPS2-30                                      An old IBM PS/2 Model 30 (286) with VGA
DOSLIB-d7d079bfd75a71b4c4d5b2afc9efc5e69cefa152     DOSLIB, by indicated commit

Equipment:

    - HDMI video capture (PEXHDCAP 1080p30)

    - VGA to HDMI adapter (one that matches the mode and converts as-is)

Software:

    - DOSLIB build:
        git commit d7d079bfd75a71b4c4d5b2afc9efc5e69cefa152

Findings:

    - VGA DAC test program shows straightforward attribute controller translation, as if
      the 8-bit value is split into two 4-bit nibbles and translated on it's way through
      the AC palette.

    - Switching off 8BIT in the attribute controller shows a strange sort of 640x200
      256-color mode, except that each pixel displayed looks as if half the value sent
      to the DAC is loaded per pixel clock before becoming the full 8-bit value.

      It's not certain yet whether the nibble value is loaded in or shifted in.

      It's not certain yet which nibble is loaded first.

    - Switching on the 8BIT in the attribute controller for any other video mode seems
      to halve the video resolution (skip every other pixel) without any other effects.

    - The "MONO" bit, listed on FreeVGA as apparently doing nothing, appears to influence
      how the blink attribute is applied on it's way to the DAC.

    - On an IBM PS/2 model 30 (VGA), the blink attribute can be switched on in any VGA
      graphics mode, which then acts on bit 3 in all modes except 256-color mode where it
      affects bit 3 and bit 7 (possibly related to the 4-bit 256-color shift behavior listed
      above).

    - If MONO=0, and graphics mode, the blink attribute seems to remap like this:

      if (color >= 8) {
        color = (color & 7) + (blink << 3);
      }
      else {
        color |= 8;
      }

    - If MONO=1, or alphanumeric (text) mode, the blink attribute seems to remap like this:

      color = (color & 7) + (blink << 3);

    - Noted, according to VGA register snapshots, is that the BIOS sets MONO=0 for all modes except
      mode 7 (80x25 mono text) and mode 15 (640x350 2-color graphics) where MONO=1.


Other ideas to follow:

    - Jim Leonard on Twitter wants to know if the vertical retrace interrupt works.

Questions to answer in further development:

    - Is the blink attribute applied before or after the attribute palette remapping?

    - What nibble is loaded first when 8BIT=0 in 256-color mode?

    - What other VGA cards does this 256-color 8BIT=0 behavior occur, or more specifically,
      what do clone cards do in this case?

    - Is the value simply replaced a nibble at a time or is it shifted 4 bits and loaded?

    - The Tseng ET4000, known to replace only the low 4 bits, should be re-tested with the
      new code and to see what odd behaviors it has.

    - Do other SVGA cards remap through the attribute controller in a way that the blink
      attribute can affect the output in any mode?

    - Regarding the vertical retrace interrupt, does it work on the PS/2?

    - What other SVGA cards does the vertical retrace interrupt work on?

    - Do these SVGA cards work as documented, or do they ignore certain behaviors, act different,
      etc?

Ideas for further development:

    - DOSLIB VGA test program to demonstrate vertical retrace interrupt, whether it's occurring,
      whether it works as documented.
