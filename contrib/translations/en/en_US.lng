.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_MOUNT_START
←[32;1mHere are some commands to get you started:←[0m
Before you can use the files located on your own filesystem,
you have to mount the directory containing the files.


.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_MOUNT_EXST_WINDOWS
←[32mmount c c:\dosgames\←[37m will create a C drive with c:\dosgames as contents.
.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_MOUNT_EXEN_WINDOWS
c:\dosgames\←[37m is an example. Replace it with your own games directory.  ←[37m 
.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_MOUNT_EXST_OTHER
←[32mmount c ~/dosgames←[37m will create a C drive with ~/dosgames as contents.
.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_MOUNT_EXEN_OTHER
←[32m~/dosgames←[37m is an example. Replace it with your own games directory.←[37m  
.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_MOUNT_END
When the mount has successfully completed you can type ←[34;1mc:←[0m to go to your freshly
mounted C: drive. Typing ←[34;1mdir←[0m there will show its contents. ←[34;1mcd←[0m will allow you to
enter a directory (recognised by the ←[33;1m[]←[0m in a directory listing).
You can run programs/files which end with ←[31m.exe .bat←[0m and ←[31m.com←[0m.

.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM
←[2J←[32;1mHow to mount a Real/Virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox-X:←[0m
DOSBox-X provides CD-ROM emulation on several levels.

The ←[33mbasic←[0m level works on all CD-ROM drives and normal directories.
It installs MSCDEX and marks the files read-only.
Usually this is enough for most games:
←[34;1mmount d ←[0;31mD:\←[34;1m -t cdrom←[0m   or   ←[34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom←[0m
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox-X the label of the CD-ROM:
←[34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL←[0m

The ←[33mnext←[0m level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
←[34;1mmount d ←[0;31mD:\←[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd ←[33m0←[0m

The ←[33mlast←[0m level of support depends on your Operating System:
For ←[1mWindows 2000←[0m, ←[1mWindows XP←[0m and ←[1mLinux←[0m:
←[34;1mmount d ←[0;31mD:\←[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd ←[33m0 ←[34m-ioctl←[0m
For ←[1mWindows 9x←[0m with a ASPI layer installed:
←[34;1mmount d ←[0;31mD:\←[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd ←[33m0 ←[34m-aspi←[0m

Replace ←[0;31mD:\←[0m with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the ←[33;1m0←[0m in ←[34;1m-usecd ←[33m0←[0m with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
←[34;1mmount -cd←[0m

.
:PROGRAM_BOOT_NOT_EXIST
Bootdisk file does not exist.  Failing.

.
:PROGRAM_BOOT_NOT_OPEN
Cannot open bootdisk file.  Failing.

.
:PROGRAM_BOOT_WRITE_PROTECTED
Image file is read-only! Boot in write-protected mode.

.
:PROGRAM_BOOT_PRINT_ERROR
This command boots DOSBox-X from either a floppy or hard disk image.

For this command, one can specify a succession of floppy disks swappable
by the menu command, and drive: specifies the mounted drive to boot from.
If no drive letter is specified, this defaults to boot from the A drive.
If no parameter is specified, it will try to boot from the current drive.
The only bootable drive letters are A, C, and D.  For booting from a hard
drive (C or D), ensure the image is already mounted by ←[34;1mIMGMOUNT←[0m command.

The syntax of this command is one of the following:

←[34;1mBOOT [driveletter:] [-convertfat|-convertfatro|-noconvertfat]←[0m

←[34;1mBOOT diskimg1.img [diskimg2.img ...] [-L driveletter]←[0m

Note: An image file with a leading colon (:) will be booted in write-protected
mode if the "leading colon write protect image" option is enabled.

Examples:

←[32;1mBOOT A:←[0m       - boot from drive A: if it is mounted and bootable.
←[32;1mBOOT :DOS.IMG←[0m - boot from floppy image DOS.IMG in write-protected mode.

  After entering cheat mode, in all commands, values or addresses starting 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP2
with `0x` are hexadecimal numbers, and all values not starting with `0x` are 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP3
decimal. Other number bases are currently not supported. If any illegal 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP4
characters appear in a hexadecimal or decimal value, that value will become 0.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP5
 All commands and their parameters are case-insensitive. The following is an 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP6
example of this command:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP7
    HELP HELP
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP8
In the game, press `Alt+Pause` or open the debug menu and select the first 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP9
item to enter debug mode. At the very bottom of the debug window is the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP10
command line. Enter `cheat [project name]` here to enter cheat mode. Cheat 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP11
mode will create a `cheat` folder in the location where Dosbox-X is installed.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP12
 When any command requiring saving is executed within cheat mode, a folder 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP13
named `[project name]` will be created under the `cheat` folder. In cheat mode
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP14
, entering `help` will show a brief description of all commands. Entering 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP15
`help [command]` will show the detailed description for that specific command.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP16
 Press `[F5]` in cheat mode to resume the game execution.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP17
The standard search procedure is as follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP18
    1. SM mode          # Set the search mode
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP19
    2. SEG segment      # Set the segment address
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP20
    3. OFF offset       # Do not change unless necessary
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP21
    4. SL search_length # Do not change unless necessary
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP22
    5. S value          # Search for your target data
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP23
    6. TW value number  # Test write a value
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP24
    7. A description    # Save the temporary storage to the formal record area
.
:CHEAT_HELP_HELP25
    8. CLS              # Clear the temporary storage area
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM1
  The default search mode is WORD. The value ranges for each mode are as 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM2
follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM3
    BYTE: 0~255, WORD: 0-65535, DWORD: 0~4294967295
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM4
You should choose the mode based on the maximum possible value of the game 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM5
character's attribute. For example, for money, if its maximum value might 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM6
exceed 65535, you should set the search mode to DWORD without hesitation. This
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM7
 will likely help you quickly find the memory address storing the money value.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM8
 Most games do not store values as negative numbers, so negative values are 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM9
not currently considered. Using BYTE mode might yield too many search results,
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM10
 so it is not recommended. Command examples:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM11
    SM DWORD     # Set the search mode to DOUBLE WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM12
    SM 4         # Set the search mode to DOUBLE WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM13
    SM BYTE      # Set the search mode to BYTE
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM14
    SM 1         # Set the search mode to BYTE
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM15
    SM           # Set the search mode to WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM16
    SM 2         # Set the search mode to WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SM17
    SM WORD      # Set the search mode to WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG1
  The 80x86 CPU uses "Segment:Offset" to point to physical memory addresses. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG2
Both the segment and offset are 16-bit values. The physical address is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG3
calculated as "Segment * 16 + Offset". Users don't need to understand how to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG4
calculate the physical address, but the game might use the DS, ES, or CS 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG5
registers to point to the area storing character attributes. Therefore, before
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG6
 searching, you must set the `SEG` to point to the DS, ES, or CS register. If 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG7
you don't know which segment the game data resides in, set the `SEG` to 0. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG8
This enables linear address mode, allowing you to search the entire memory 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG9
range. However, this significantly increases the search scope, so using the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG10
"Segment:Offset" method is recommended whenever possible. Command examples:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG11
    SEG ES      # Set the segment address to follow the ES register
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG12
    SEG 0x9117  # Set the segment address to the hexadecimal value 0x9117
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG13
    SEG 0       # Use linear addressing, ignoring segment registers
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG14
Setting the `SEG` value to follow the DS, ES, or CS registers carries risks 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG15
because the game process might change the values of these registers. It's 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG16
possible that during the search phase they point to the correct address and 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG17
allow you to find the correct offset. However, as the game continues execution
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG18
, they might point elsewhere, rendering the offset address you found earlier 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG19
useless. Therefore, it is recommended to set the `SEG` value by referring to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG20
the top of the DEBUG screen, which displays the values of the DS and ES 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG21
registers (in hexadecimal). Use these values as a reference to set the correct
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG22
 segment address using the `SEG` command. If the game enters protected mode, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG23
the `SEG` value *must* be set to 0. Setting it to any other value will be 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG24
ineffective. The search length depends on the memory size set in the Dosbox-X 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG25
configuration file. If you truly have no concept of registers and are 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG26
completely unsure whether to use DS, ES, or CS, you can simply set the `SEG` 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG27
value to 0. This will greatly increase the search length, but the benefit is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG28
that you will almost certainly find your target (unless the game uses encoding
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG29
 methods to store character attributes, which is beyond this program's 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SEG30
capability to solve).
.
:CHEAT_HELP_OFF1
  Unless you already know the memory address where the search target is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_OFF2
located, you generally don't need to set this value. It's best to leave it at 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_OFF3
the default value of 0. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_OFF4
    OFF 0xEB00     # Set the offset address to 0xEB00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_OFF5
Unless you know what you are doing, it is not recommended to set the offset 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_OFF6
address. Keep it set to 0.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL1
  The system sets the search length based on your configured search conditions
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL2
. Unless you specifically know the required search range, you do not need to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL3
modify this value. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL4
    SL 0x10000  # Set the search length to 64KB
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL5
When the `SEG` value is not 0, the default search length is 64KB. When the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL6
`SEG` value is 0, the search length is 640KB or 1088KB, depending on whether 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL7
HI MEMORY is enabled. If the game enters protected mode, the `SEG` value must 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL8
be set to 0; setting it to any other value is invalid. The search length 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SL9
depends on the memory size set in the Dosbox-X configuration file.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D1
  Sometimes after searching, you might end up with only a few pieces of data 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D2
that match the criteria. You can use this command to specify the memory 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D3
segment to be displayed in the Data View to assist with your judgment. You 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D4
only need to provide the address given to you by the search command as a 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D5
parameter, and the system will automatically calculate the actual memory 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D6
address for you. Suppose the following is the content displayed from one of my
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D7
 searches:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D8
    1 : 9594 <==> 0x257A, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D9
    2 : 60174 <==> 0xEB0E, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D10
    3 : 60178 <==> 0xEB12, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D11
    4 : 60276 <==> 0xEB74, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D12
    5 : 60280 <==> 0xEB78, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D13
    6 : 60378 <==> 0xEBDA, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D14
    7 : 60382 <==> 0xEBDE, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D15
    8 : 60480 <==> 0xEC40, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D16
    9 : 60484 <==> 0xEC44, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D17
If you want to see the memory condition around the 2nd entry, you can issue 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D18
the following command:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D19
    D 0xEB00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D20
This will make the Data View start displaying data from address 0xEB00. You 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D21
might wonder, since the address of the 2nd entry is clearly 0xEB0E, why would 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D22
I start displaying from 0xEB00? I do this in the hope that all displayed 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D23
addresses are aligned to end with a '0'. This makes it easier to calculate the
.
:CHEAT_HELP_D24
 address of any nearby data that you find interesting.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV1
  Sometimes after searching, you might end up with only a few pieces of data 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV2
that match the criteria. You can use this command to specify the memory 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV3
segment to be displayed in the Data View in linear memory mode to assist with 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV4
judgment. In this case, the address you provide is the linear memory address, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV5
and the system will ignore the segment address value. The theoretical maximum 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV6
linear memory address is 4GB, but the actual limit depends on the memory size 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV7
you configured in the Dosbox-X settings file. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV8
    DV 0x100000  # Display memory content starting from 1024KB
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV9
When the game enters protected mode, because protected mode ignores segment 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV10
address values, you must use the DV command to correctly display the memory 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_DV11
content.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S1
  After configuring the search mode, segment address, offset address, and 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S2
search length, you can use this command to search for the specified value. The
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S3
 search results will be displayed in the Output window. The system will only 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S4
show the first 10 found memory addresses. If there are more than 10 results, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S5
it indicates that further searching is needed to find the correct target. You 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S6
can stop searching when only 1 result remains, or when the results remain 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S7
consistent across successive searches. Use further commands to test if the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S8
search result is correct. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S9
    s 100000 # This means searching for one hundred thousand
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S10
Suppose your in-game money value is 100,000. The first search using `s 100000`
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S11
 might yield many results. Press the `F5` key to continue the game. When the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S12
money value changes in the game, enter debug mode again and search for the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S13
changed amount. If the changed amount is 94,000, you can use the following 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S14
command to search:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S15
    s 94000  # Search for 94000 from the previous results
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S16
If only 1 result remains, it's highly likely this is your target. If more than
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S17
 1 result remains, press `F5` to continue the game, and search again after the
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S18
 in-game money changes, until only 1 result remains or the results stabilize. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S19
Below is an example of a search result:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S20
    1 : 9594 <==> 0x257A, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S21
    2 : 60174 <==> 0xEB0E, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S22
    3 : 60178 <==> 0xEB12, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S23
    4 : 60276 <==> 0xEB74, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S24
    5 : 60280 <==> 0xEB78, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S25
    6 : 60378 <==> 0xEBDA, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S26
    7 : 60382 <==> 0xEBDE, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S27
    8 : 60480 <==> 0xEC40, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S28
    9 : 60484 <==> 0xEC44, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S29
Search result explanation: Number : Decimal Address <==> Hexadecimal Address, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_S30
Value = Searched Value
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L1
  To check the value stored at a specific address, you can use this command. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L2
In many games, related attributes of a character are often stored in nearby 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L3
memory locations. When you have confirmed the memory address of one attribute,
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L4
 it's recommended to use the `D` or `DV` command to modify the Data View 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L5
window to display the data of the specified memory block. Look around that 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L6
address; you might find the memory addresses of other attributes. Since the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L7
Data View displays data in hexadecimal, using this command allows you to view 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L8
the value at that address in decimal.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L9
Here is part of the content displayed in the Data View after I used the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L10
command `D 0XEB00`:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L11
    9117:0000EB00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 A0 86
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L12
    9117:0000EB10 01 00 A0 86 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 64 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L13
    9117:0000EB20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 64 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L14
    9117:0000EB30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9A 01 19 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L15
    9117:0000EB40 23 00 1E 00 2D 00 3C 00 CD 01 01 03 00 00 0A 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L16
The `9117:0000EB10` on the second line represents `Segment:Offset`. The first 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L17
value in that line is `0x01` in hexadecimal. The offset address here is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L18
`0xEB10`. Moving one cell to the right is `0xEB11`, and so on. The last 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L19
address in this line is `0xEB1F`. Each line occupies 16 bytes. Please note the
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L20
 four bytes `0xA0`, `0x86`, `0x01`, `0x00` at the end of the first line. The 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L21
starting address of this line is `0xEB00`, so the address of `0xA0` is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L22
`0xEB0E`.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L23
When I use:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L24
    L 0xEB0E BYTE
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L25
It means I want to interpret the value at this address in BYTE mode. You will 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L26
see the Output list:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L27
    Memory EB0E value is 160    # Hexadecimal is 0xA0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L28
Using `L 0xEB0E WORD` will show:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L29
    Memory EB0E value is 34464  # Hexadecimal is 0x86A0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L30
Using `L 0xEB0E DWORD` will show:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L31
    Memory EB0E value is 100000 # Hexadecimal is 0x000186A0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L32
Note 1: This explanation is based on the game I am running. The game you are 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L33
running is different, so you will absolutely not see the same results.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L34
Note 2: When using the command `L 0xEB0E` without specifying a mode, the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_L35
system will use the mode set by the `SM` command as the default.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TL1
  After performing a search and then other operations, you might not see the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TL2
previously displayed search results. Alternatively, if you have just loaded an
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TL3
 unfinished search from the temporary storage area, you can use this command 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TL4
to display the first 10 entries. This command does not take any parameters; 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TL5
simply enter the command and press [ENTER] to execute it.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TD1
  When your search has narrowed down to just a few entries, and testing has 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TD2
confirmed that certain entries are not useful, you can use this command to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TD3
delete them. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TD4
    TD 2     # Delete the second entry in the temporary storage area
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW1
  When your search has narrowed down to just a few or even a single result, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW2
you may need to test by modifying the memory content and then returning to the
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW3
 game to check if the change was successful. You can use this command for that
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW4
 purpose. Usage example: 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW5
Suppose the search results are as follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW6
    1 : 9594 <==> 0x257A, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW7
    2 : 60174 <==> 0xEB0E, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW8
    3 : 60178 <==> 0xEB12, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW9
    4 : 60276 <==> 0xEB74, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW10
    5 : 60280 <==> 0xEB78, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW11
    6 : 60378 <==> 0xEBDA, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW12
    7 : 60382 <==> 0xEBDE, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW13
    8 : 60480 <==> 0xEC40, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW14
    9 : 60484 <==> 0xEC44, Value = 100000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW15
The following command changes the value of the second entry to 200000. If the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW16
last parameter is omitted, it will modify the first entry by default.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW17
    TW 200000 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW18
If returning to the game shows that the desired effect was not achieved, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW19
remember to change it back:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW20
    TW 100000 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW21
If returning to the game confirms that the game attribute has changed to your 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW22
desired value, use the `TD` command to delete the extra search results until 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TW23
only this one entry remains.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS1
  Save the search settings and the temporary search storage area into a file 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS2
with the specified name. The file will be stored in the "cheat/[project name]"
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS3
 folder, with the filename "[name].tmp". The typical use case for this command
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS4
 is at the beginning of a game, when you have multiple targets to search for. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS5
You can configure the search settings, perform a search using the `s` command,
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS6
 and then immediately use this command to save both the search settings and 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS7
the temporary storage area. Afterwards, use `cls` to clear the temporary 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS8
storage area, configure the search settings for the next target, perform 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS9
another search with the `s` command, and save again. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS10
    TS CASH
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS11
This will save the current settings and temporary storage area into a file 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TS12
named `CASH.tmp`.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TR1
  Read the data from the temporary storage area to continue searching. The 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TR2
data in the temporary storage area is stored in the "cheat/[project name]" 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TR3
folder. Please open that folder yourself to check which temporary storage 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TR4
files are available to read. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_TR5
    TR CASH
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A1
  When there is only one piece of data left in the temporary storage area and 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A2
it has been tested and confirmed to be the correct address, you can use this 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A3
command to add the data from the temporary storage area to the formal data 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A4
record area. A record description must be specified when adding. Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A5
    A CASH
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A6
This action should only be performed when there is only one piece of data left
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A7
 in the temporary storage area and it has been tested and confirmed to be the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A8
correct address. Because the input area in debug mode cannot switch input 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A9
methods, the record description can only consist of raw characters that can be
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A10
 input directly from the keyboard. If necessary, after saving the file, you 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A11
can use a text editor to open the project file. Each record in the record area
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A12
 starts with the record description and uses as a separator. You can edit the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A13
description content before the symbol to change it to your desired language 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A14
description. Please note that the description content must never contain the `
.
:CHEAT_HELP_A15
 symbol, as this would compromise the integrity of the project file.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R1
  List the data entries in the formal record area. If you have used a text 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R2
editor to change the descriptions to another language, the description text 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R3
will be displayed in the language you edited. Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R4
    R
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R5
Using this command lists all data entries in the record area.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R6
    R 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R7
Using this command lists the detailed content of the second data entry in the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_R8
record area..
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR1
  After data is saved to the formal record area, you can use this command to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR2
directly modify its value. Typically, you would first use the `R` command to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR3
list all records and identify the target record number. Then, use this command
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR4
 to make the modification. Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR5
    WR 200000 1
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR6
Assuming the first record represents cash, this command would change the cash 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_WR7
value to 200000.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CLS1
  Clear the temporary storage area to prepare for the next search. Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CLS2
    CLS
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE1
  Save the data from the formal record area into the project file. The data is
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE2
 stored in the "cheat/[project name]" folder, and the filename is "[project 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE3
name].prj". Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE4
    SAVE
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE5
When you use the "cheat [project name]" command in debug mode to enter cheat 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE6
mode, it will automatically load the previously saved records and display the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SAVE7
number of records loaded in the output area.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM1
  This command marks the entry into the memory operation mode. All commands in
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM2
 this mode start with `M`. This mode allows direct manipulation of memory 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM3
content. he typical use case for this mode is when a game likely stores 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM4
important numerical values clustered together. After you have identified a 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM5
specific target, you can set the Data View to display the memory content of 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM6
that block. Upon inspection, you might discover that nearby memory locations 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM7
contain other targets you are seeking. At this point, you can use a series of 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM8
commands in the memory operation mode to test the results. Once confirmed, you
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM9
 can directly add the results to the formal record area. The purpose of this 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM10
specific command is to set the base data size for the memory mode. Examples:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM11
    MM 1
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM12
    MM BYTE
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM13
The above sets the memory mode to BYTE.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM14
    MM 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM15
    MM WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM16
The above sets the memory mode to WORD.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM17
    MM 4
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM18
    MM DWORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MM19
The above sets the memory mode to DWORD.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG1
  Set the segment address for memory mode. You can directly use `CS`, `DS`, or
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG2
 `ES` to substitute for the actual value. However, since the game process may 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG3
change the values of these registers at any time, it is highly recommended 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG4
**not** to use these three registers to set the segment address. You should 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG5
use the actual numerical value to set the segment address. You can see the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG6
current actual values of these registers at the top of the debug mode window. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG7
Examples:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG8
    MSEG ES
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG9
This sets the segment address to point to the current value of the ES register
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG10
.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG11
    MSEG 0X9117
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG12
This sets the segment address to point to `0x9117`. The reason for setting 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG13
this value is that I observed the current value of the ES register is `0x9117`
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MSEG14
, so I replaced the ES register with the actual numerical value.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF1
  Set the offset address for memory mode. Unlike setting the offset to 0 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF2
during searches, here you need to set the offset address to the confirmed 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF3
target memory address. Then use the `MD` command to make the DATA VIEW window 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF4
display the memory content of this segment, and observe if the values in the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF5
nearby memory match certain attributes of the game character. Suppose I use 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF6
the following series of commands to set up the memory mode. This example is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF7
based on a specific game I am running. Since the game you are running is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF8
different, you should configure the settings according to your own game's 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF9
context.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF10
    MM DWORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF11
    MSEG 0x9117
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF12
    MOFF 0xEB0E
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF13
    MD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF14
You will see the following lines in the debug window:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF15
    9117:0000EB0E A0 86 01 00 A0 86 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF16
    9117:0000EB1E 64 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF17
    9117:0000EB2E 64 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9A 01
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF18
    9117:0000EB3E 19 00 23 00 1E 00 2D 00 3C 00 CD 01 01 03 00 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF19
Another attribute value in the game is 100, which converts to the hexadecimal 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF20
value `0x64`. You can see that the values at both `0xEB1E` and `0xEB2E` are:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF21
    64 00 00 00
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF22
Since this attribute value is relatively small, it is推测 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF23
(inferred/speculated) that its data type should be WORD. Use the following two
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF24
 commands to change the address and data size:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF25
    MM 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF26
    MOFF 0xEB2E # Already tested and confirmed to be this address
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF27
For subsequent steps, please refer to the `MD`, `MR`, `MS`, and `MA` command 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MOFF28
instructions.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW1
  Based on the configured parameters like `MM`, `MSEG`, and `MOFF`, write the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW2
specified value into memory. After writing, press `[F5]` to continue executing
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW3
 the game and check if the address is correct. Before execution, be sure to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW4
remember the original value at the memory address. If the written value has no
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW5
 effect, remember to re-enter debug mode and restore the original value. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW6
Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW7
    MW 3000
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW8
If the `MM` mode is BYTE,  it affects 1 byte. The value written is the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW9
remainder of 3000 divided by 256.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW10
If the `MM` mode is WORD,  it affects 2 bytes. The value written is the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW11
remainder of 3000 divided by 65536.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW12
If the `MM` mode is DWORD, it affects 4 bytes. The value written is the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MW13
remainder of 3000 divided by 4294967295.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA1
  If you have confirmed that this setting is your desired target, use this 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA2
command to save the setting into the formal record area. After saving, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA3
remember to use the SAVE command to write it to the project file. Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA4
    MA description
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA5
The description can only contain characters inputtable by the raw keyboard 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA6
setting language. If necessary, you can use a text editor to open the project 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA7
file and modify the description text. The description text cannot use the ` 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA8
character, as it is the field delimiter. Unless you know what you are doing, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA9
do not modify data in other fields. The project file must be saved in UTF-8 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_MA10
Without BOM format.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP1
  If you lack a clear concept of how to search, you can use Snap mode. Note: 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP2
this command is invalid if you are currently in search mode or already in Snap
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP3
 mode. Before executing this command, please use `SM`, `SEG`, and `OFF` to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP4
configure your search settings. These settings cannot be changed after 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP5
entering Snap mode. Command example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP6
    SNAP
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP7
If a `SEG` value is set, after executing this command, the cheat tool will 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP8
save the current state of the 64KB memory segment into a temporary file for 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP9
future comparison. If the `SEG` value is set to 0, the cheat tool will save 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP10
the state of all current memory into the temporary file. If the game you are 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP11
running is a DOS-based game that enters protected mode (e.g., DOOM), it is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP12
recommended to set the memory size to 4MB in the Dosbox-X configuration. The 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP13
default memory size in Dosbox-X is 16MB. Using a larger memory size will 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SNAP14
significantly increase the size of the temporary snapshot file.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU1
  After entering Snap mode and continuing the game, use this command to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU2
continue searching if the value you want to search for is **larger than** the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU3
value when entering "Snap mode" or **larger than the value from the last 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU4
search**. Usage is as follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU5
    SU
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU6
This method is suitable for values like health bars, where the exact value is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU7
unknown, allowing only fuzzy searches. This approach may require many attempts
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU8
 to find your target. Alternatively, you can use:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU9
    SU 10
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU10
This method is suitable when the exact numerical difference is known. For 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU11
example, if your money starts at 1000, use SNAP, then enter the game and earn 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU12
10 more. You can then enter debug mode and use `SU 10` to search quickly. If 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU13
the search results are still numerous, press `[F5]` to return to the game, 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SU14
wait for the value to change again, and then search once more.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD1
  After entering Snap mode and continuing the game, use this command to 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD2
continue searching if the value you want to search for is **smaller than** the
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD3
 value when entering "Snap mode" or **smaller than the value from the last 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD4
search**. Usage is as follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD5
    SD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD6
This method is suitable for values like health bars, where the exact value is 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD7
unknown, allowing only fuzzy searches. This approach may require many attempts
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD8
 to find your target. Alternatively, you can use:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD9
    SD 10
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD10
This method is suitable when the exact numerical difference is known. For 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD11
example, if your money starts at 1000, use SNAP, then enter the game and spend
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD12
 10. You can then enter debug mode and use `SD 10` to search quickly. If the 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD13
search results are still numerous, press `[F5]` to return to the game, wait 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SD14
for the value to change again, and then search once more.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS1
  This command is only applicable under the following conditions:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS2
    1. You have entered Snap mode using the `SNAP` command.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS3
    2. You have performed at least one search using the `SU` or `SD` command.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS4
After searching and knowing the current correct value, you can use this 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS5
command to search further. Suppose at the beginning of the game, the quantity 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS6
of a certain item is 1. The search command sequence would be as follows:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS7
    SM WORD
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS8
    SEG 0x9117
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS9
    SNAP
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS10
Then press `[F5]` to return to the game, use the item, and re-enter debug mode
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS11
.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS12
    SD 1
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS13
The item quantity decreased by 1, so use `SD 1` to search. Dozens of results 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS14
are found. Since the item quantity is now 0, use the following command next:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS15
    SS 0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS16
After this search, only the following two results remain:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS17
1 : 53302 <==> 0xD036, value = 0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS18
2 : 57340 <==> 0xDFFC, value = 0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS19
At this point, you can use trial and error with the command:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS20
    TW 9 1
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS21
This writes the value 9 to temporary storage entry 1. Press `[F5]` to return 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS22
to the game and observe that the item quantity has changed to 9. Then use:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS23
    TD 2
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS24
to delete the second entry from the temporary storage area. Finally, use:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS25
    A Item_Name
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS26
    SAVE
.
:CHEAT_HELP_SS27
to save the search result to the project file.
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT1
  This command allows users to perform decimal <=> hexadecimal conversion. 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT2
Inputting a decimal number will output its hexadecimal equivalent, and 
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT3
inputting a hexadecimal number will output its decimal equivalent. Example:
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT4
    CVT 100     #Outputs 0x64
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT5
    CVT 10000   #Outputs 0x2710
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT6
    CVT 100000  #Outputs 0x000186A0
.
:CHEAT_HELP_CVT7
    CVT 0xABC   #Outputs 2748
.
