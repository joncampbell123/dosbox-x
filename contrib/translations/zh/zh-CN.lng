:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM
[2J[32;1mHow to mount a Real/Virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox-X:[0m
DOSBox-X provides CD-ROM emulation on several levels.

The [33mbasic[0m level works on all CD-ROM drives and normal directories.
It installs MSCDEX and marks the files read-only.
Usually this is enough for most games:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom[0m   or   [34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom[0m
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox-X the label of the CD-ROM:
