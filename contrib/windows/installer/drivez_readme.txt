This is DOSBox-X's internal virtual Drive Z:. It contains various utilities
that make a reasonable approximation of a fully setup DOS-like environment.
The Z drive is automatically inserted to the front of the PATH.

You can also add your own programs or files to the Z drive by putting them in
the drivez subdirectory of the DOSBox-X program or configuration directory.
If any of them have the same file names as the built-in ones (e.g. EDIT.COM
and XCOPY.EXE), they will replace the built-in ones.

You can also hide built-in files with the "drive z hide files" config option.
