Welcome to DOSBox-X, a cross-platform DOS emulator with the goal of being a complete DOS emulation package that is both fully-featured and easy to use.

Like DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.

As a general-purpose DOS emulator, DOSBox-X has many useful and unique features that do not exist in other emulators like DOSBox, such as GUI menu and configuration tool, the ability to save and load states, support for more DOS commands and utilities, better compatibility with DOS applications, pixel-perfect scaling and TrueType font (TTF) outputs, as well as features like Windows clipboard and long filename support for a tighter integration with Windows. With DOSBox-X you can run almost all DOS applications and games reliably in a DOS virtual machine. Please read the README.TXT file in the installation directory for a quick start, or see the dosbox-x.conf file for more information about optional settings in DOSBox-X.

Note: Due to the way of how Windows works, access to the "Program Files" folder requires administrative permissions. Unless you have specific reasons, we recommend that you install DOSBox-X in a different folder that does not require administrative permissions.
