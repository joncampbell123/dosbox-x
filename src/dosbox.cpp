/* NTS: Valgrind hunting shows memory leak from C++ new operator somewhere
 *      with the JACK library indirectly invoked by SDL audio. Can we resolve
 *      that too eventually? */

/* NTS: Valgrind hunting also shows one of the section INIT functions (I can't
 *      yet tell which one because the stack trace doesn't show it) is allocating
 *      something and is not freeing it. */

/* NTS: Valgrind hunting has a moderate to high signal-to-noise ratio because
 *      of memory leaks (lazy memory allocation) from other libraries in the
 *      system, including:
 *
 *         ncurses
 *         libSDL
 *         libX11 and libXCB
 *         libasound (ALSA sound library)
 *         PulseAudio library calls
 *         JACK library calls
 *         libdl (the dlopen/dlclose functions allocate something and never free it)
 *         and a whole bunch of unidentified malloc calls without a matching free.
 *
 *      On my dev system, a reported leak of 450KB (77KB possibly lost + 384KB still reachable
 *      according to Valgrind) is normal.
 *
 *      Now you ask: why do I care so much about Valgrind, memory leaks, and cleaning
 *      up the code? The less spurious memory leaks, the easier it is to identify
 *      actual leaks among the noise and to patch them up. Thus, "valgrind hunting" --J.C. */

     *
     * These hacks reduce emulation accuracy but can be set to work around bugs or mistakes in some old
     * games and demos related to handling the Sound Blaster IRQ.
     *
     * - Saga by Dust (1993):
     *     Sound Blaster support has a fatal flaw in that the Sound Blaster interrupt handler it installs assumes
     *     DS == CS. It uses the DS register to read local variables needed to manage the Sound Blaster card but
     *     it makes no attempt to push DS and then load the DS segment value it needs. While the demo may seem to
     *     run normally at first, eventually the interrupt is fired at just the right time to catch the demo in
     *     the middle of it's graphics routines (DS=A000). Since the ISR uses DS to load the Sound Blaster DSP
     *     I/O port, it reads some random value from *video RAM* and then hangs in a loop waiting for that I/O
     *     port to clear bit 7! Setting 'cs_equ_ds' works around that bug by instructing PIC emulation not to
     *     fire the interrupt unless segment registers CS and DS match. */
