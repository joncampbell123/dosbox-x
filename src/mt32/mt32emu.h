/* API Configuration */

/* 0: Use full-featured C++ API. Well suitable when the library is to be linked statically.
 *    When the library is shared, ABI compatibility may be an issue. Therefore, it should
 *    only be used within a project comprising of several modules to share the library code.
 * 1: Use C-compatible API. Make the library looks as a regular C library with well-defined ABI.
 *    This is also crucial when the library is to be linked with modules in a different
 *    language, either statically or dynamically.
 * 2: Use plugin-like API via C-interface wrapped in a C++ class. This is mainly intended
 *    for a shared library being dynamically loaded in run-time. To get access to all the library
 *    services, a client application only needs to bind with a single factory function.
 * 3: Use optimised C++ API compatible with the plugin API (type 2). The facade class also wraps
 *    the C functions but they are invoked directly. This enables the compiler to generate better
 *    code for the library when linked statically yet being consistent with the plugin-like API.
