/**
 * \mainpage SDL_sound
 *
 * The latest version of SDL_sound can be found at:
 *     http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/
 *
 * The basic gist of SDL_sound is that you use an SDL_RWops to get sound data
 *  into this library, and SDL_sound will take that data, in one of several
 *  popular formats, and decode it into raw waveform data in the format of
 *  your choice. This gives you a nice abstraction for getting sound into your
 *  game or application; just feed it to SDL_sound, and it will handle
 *  decoding and converting, so you can just pass it to your SDL audio
 *  callback (or whatever). Since it gets data from an SDL_RWops, you can get
 *  the initial sound data from any number of sources: file, memory buffer,
 *  network connection, etc.
 *
 * As the name implies, this library depends on SDL: Simple Directmedia Layer,
 *  which is a powerful, free, and cross-platform multimedia library. It can
 *  be found at http://www.libsdl.org/
 *
 * Support is in place or planned for the following sound formats:
 *   - .WAV  (Microsoft WAVfile RIFF data, internal.)
 *   - .VOC  (Creative Labs' Voice format, internal.)
 *   - .MP3  (MPEG-1 Layer 3 support, via libmpg123.)
 *   - .MID  (MIDI music converted to Waveform data, internal.)
 *   - .MOD  (MOD files, via MikMod and ModPlug.)
 *   - .OGG  (Ogg Vorbis files, via the Vorbis libraries.)
 *   - .OPUS (Ogg Opus files, via the Opus libraries.)
 *   - .SPX  (Speex files, via libspeex.)
 *   - .SHN  (Shorten files, internal.)
 *   - .RAW  (Raw sound data in any format, internal.)
 *   - .AU   (Sun's Audio format, internal.)
 *   - .AIFF (Audio Interchange format, internal.)
 *   - .FLAC (Lossless audio compression, via libFLAC.)
 *
 *   (...and more to come...)

/**
 * \fn Sound_Sample *Sound_NewSample(SDL_RWops *rw, const char *ext, Sound_AudioInfo *desired, Uint32 bufferSize)
 * \brief Start decoding a new sound sample.
 *
 * The data is read via an SDL_RWops structure (see SDL_rwops.h in the SDL
 *  include directory), so it may be coming from memory, disk, network stream,
 *  etc. The (ext) parameter is merely a hint to determining the correct
 *  decoder; if you specify, for example, "mp3" for an extension, and one of
 *  the decoders lists that as a handled extension, then that decoder is given
 *  first shot at trying to claim the data for decoding. If none of the
 *  extensions match (or the extension is NULL), then every decoder examines
 *  the data to determine if it can handle it, until one accepts it. In such a
 *  case your SDL_RWops will need to be capable of rewinding to the start of
 *  the stream.
 *
 * If no decoders can handle the data, a NULL value is returned, and a human
 *  readable error message can be fetched from Sound_GetError().
 *
 * Optionally, a desired audio format can be specified. If the incoming data
 *  is in a different format, SDL_sound will convert it to the desired format
 *  on the fly. Note that this can be an expensive operation, so it may be
 *  wise to convert data before you need to play it back, if possible, or
 *  make sure your data is initially in the format that you need it in.
 *  If you don't want to convert the data, you can specify NULL for a desired
 *  format. The incoming format of the data, preconversion, can be found
 *  in the Sound_Sample structure.
 *
 * Note that the raw sound data "decoder" needs you to specify both the
 *  extension "RAW" and a "desired" format, or it will refuse to handle
 *  the data. This is to prevent it from catching all formats unsupported
 *  by the other decoders.
 *
 * Finally, specify an initial buffer size; this is the number of bytes that
 *  will be allocated to store each read from the sound buffer. The more you
 *  can safely allocate, the more decoding can be done in one block, but the
 *  more resources you have to use up, and the longer each decoding call will
 *  take. Note that different data formats require more or less space to
 *  store. This buffer can be resized via Sound_SetBufferSize() ...
 *
 * The buffer size specified must be a multiple of the size of a single
 *  sample point. So, if you want 16-bit, stereo samples, then your sample
 *  point size is (2 channels * 16 bits), or 32 bits per sample, which is four
 *  bytes. In such a case, you could specify 128 or 132 bytes for a buffer,
 *  but not 129, 130, or 131 (although in reality, you'll want to specify a
 *  MUCH larger buffer).
 *
 * When you are done with this Sound_Sample pointer, you can dispose of it
 *  via Sound_FreeSample().
 *
 * You do not have to keep a reference to (rw) around. If this function
 *  succeeds, it stores (rw) internally (and disposes of it during the call
 *  to Sound_FreeSample()). If this function fails, it will dispose of the
 *  SDL_RWops for you.

 *
 * Restart a sample at the start of its waveform data, as if newly
 *  created with Sound_NewSample(). If successful, the next call to
 *  Sound_Decode[All]() will give audio data from the earliest point
 *  in the stream.
 *
 * Beware that this function will fail if the SDL_RWops that feeds the
 *  decoder can not be rewound via it's seek method, but this can
 *  theoretically be avoided by wrapping it in some sort of buffering
 *  SDL_RWops.
 *
 * This function should ONLY fail if the RWops is not seekable, or
 *  SDL_sound is not initialized. Both can be controlled by the application,
 *  and thus, it is up to the developer's paranoia to dictate whether this
 *  function's return value need be checked at all.
 *
 * If this function fails, the state of the sample is undefined, but it
 *  is still safe to call Sound_FreeSample() to dispose of it.
 *
 * On success, ERROR, EOF, and EAGAIN are cleared from sample->flags. The
 *  ERROR flag is set on error.

/**
 * \fn int Sound_Seek(Sound_Sample *sample, Uint32 ms)
 * \brief Seek to a different point in a sample.
 *
 * Reposition a sample's stream. If successful, the next call to
 *  Sound_Decode[All]() will give audio data from the offset you
 *  specified.
 *
 * The offset is specified in milliseconds from the start of the
 *  sample.
 *
 * Beware that this function can fail for several reasons. If the
 *  SDL_RWops that feeds the decoder can not seek, this call will almost
 *  certainly fail, but this can theoretically be avoided by wrapping it
 *  in some sort of buffering SDL_RWops. Some decoders can never seek,
 *  others can only seek with certain files. The decoders will set a flag
 *  in the sample at creation time to help you determine this.
 *
 * You should check sample->flags & SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_CANSEEK
 *  before attempting. Sound_Seek() reports failure immediately if this
 *  flag isn't set. This function can still fail for other reasons if the
 *  flag is set.
 *
 * This function can be emulated in the application with Sound_Rewind()
 *  and predecoding a specific amount of the sample, but this can be
 *  extremely inefficient. Sound_Seek() accelerates the seek on a
 *  with decoder-specific code.
 *
 * If this function fails, the sample should continue to function as if
 *  this call was never made. If there was an unrecoverable error,
 *  sample->flags & SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_ERROR will be set, which you regular
 *  decoding loop can pick up.
 *
 * On success, ERROR, EOF, and EAGAIN are cleared from sample->flags.
 *
 *    \param sample The Sound_Sample to seek.
 *    \param ms The new position, in milliseconds from start of sample.
 *   \return nonzero on success, zero on error. Specifics of the
