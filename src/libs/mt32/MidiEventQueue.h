/**
 * Simple queue implementation using a ring buffer to store incoming MIDI event before the synth actually processes it.
 * It is intended to:
 * - get rid of prerenderer while retaining graceful partial abortion
 * - add fair emulation of the MIDI interface delays
 * - extend the synth interface with the default implementation of a typical rendering loop.
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * It is safe to use either in a single thread environment or when there are only two threads - one performs only reading
 * and one performs only writing. More complicated usage requires external synchronisation.
