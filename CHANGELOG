??????
  - DOSBox-X now has its internal state for NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock keys.
    Initial values are settable in the configuration. When focused, the internal
    state is switched to, when unfocused, the host state is switched to.
    (Windows) (Aybe)
    
0.82.8
  - New xBRZ scaler (with bilinear mode) (Alexat)
  - Fixed aspect ratio correction to use the ratio given by VGA emulation
    instead of assuming 4:3
  - output=surface and xBRZ now permit filling the window just like
    output=opengl and output=direct3d
  - Added critical section around Windows SDL 1.x resize code to solve
    the remaining 0.5% probability that resizing the window causes move
    and resize to stop working in Windows 10.
  - INT 10h AH=10h now ignores AL=3 in PCjr mode.
  - Fixed keyboard handler bug in PCjr mode that caused some CPU
    register corruption and general crashiness in games.
  - Improved shell: (Aybe, Joncampbell123)
    - Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right permits word-navigation.
    - Added emulation of 'Ins' key behavior.
  - Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock are now synchronized at startup
    and when DOSBox-X window gains focus again (Windows). (Aybe)
  - Added visual feedback to Hat/D-pad buttons in mapper. (Aybe)
  - Added documentation for 'dir' command sorting switches. (Aybe)
  - Menu 'Show console' is now checked with '-console' (SDL1). (Aybe)
  - Improved joystick support (see README.joystick): (Aybe)
    - Added deadzone and response for joystick axes.
    - Axes can be remapped for devices with questionable layout.
    - User-settable deadzones for joystick bindings in mapper,
      mappings like WSAD keys to axes is less frustrating.
  - Improved mouse integration (Aybe):
    - Now by default DOSBox-X does not emulate mouse movement when the mouse
      is not locked. This gives a consistent experience when compared to host OS.
      For the old behavior, use [sdl] mouse_emulation=always.
    - Added visual or auditive feedback about auto-lock state (Windows).
      This feature can be switched off, use [sdl] autolock_feedback=none.
  - Added CAPMOUSE program for capturing/releasing mouse from command line. (Aybe)
    
0.82.7
  - Mac OS X builds now honor showmenu=false by leaving the
    stock SDL menu in place at startup.
  - Default minimum MCB free/base is now 0x100, to sidestep
    unknown unstable DOS application behavior when DOS
    applications are loaded at around segment 0x800.
    This also puts DOSBox-X at parity with the base memory
    behavior of DOSBox SVN.
  - Add dosbox.conf option to set Sound BIOS enable
    bit in non-volatile RAM (PC-98) that tells older
    PC-98 games the FM card is present (Yksoft)
  - BOOT updated to boot D88 except for 2D format which
    is generally used by PC-88 disk images.
  - Added D88 disk image support
  - CMake files added (Aybe)
  - PIC timing updated to use "double" float type for
    more precision, but as a typedef for future support
    as a compile time option.
  - Removed geometry checks from INT 1Bh FDC functions,
    to allow non-uniform disks to work.
  - MinGW builds now allowed to use Direct3D.
  - Direct3D output fixed to use the same texture
    coordinate, window fitting, and positioning
    logic as OpenGL.
  - Update zlib and libpng libraries in-tree.
  - Fixed VFD disk image support to correctly signal
    failure to detect geometry, to avoid divide by
    zero crash with FAT driver.
  - showmenu= now taken into consideration whether to
    show the menu bar at startup
  - Fixed get_item() E_Exit crash if menus asked to
    show from dosbox.conf
  - SDL drawn menus fixed to integrate with Direct3D
    output on Windows.
  - PC-98 mode can now boot floppy disk images where the
    boot sector is 128 or 256 bytes/sector despite
    track 1 and higher having 1024 bytes/sector.
  - General codebase cleanup, compiler warning cleanup.
  - Enable XInput support on Windows (Aybe)
  - Fixed SDL drawn menus to use std::vector properly,
    not to hold onto iterators while resizing the vector
    and popping things off the top.
  - PC-98 INT 1Bh "read id" floppy disk call fixed to
    cycle through sector numbers. Some bootable PC-98
    games use "MEGDOS" which polls this BIOS call before
    attempting to read the disk. If the sector numbers
    never cycle, "MEGDOS" will not attempt to read the
    disk.
  - Fixed bug that prevented some menu options (such as
    "aspect ratio") from working if still in the BIOS or
    booted into a guest OS.
  - PC-98 mode fixed to ignore "mainline compatible mapping".
    That mapping mode refers to DOSBox SVN which never
    supported PC-98 mode anyway.
  - Fix PC-98 INT 1Bh "test read" call, which then allows
    "cherry bomb" to run.
  - Remove geometry checks in PC-98 INT 1Bh BIOS call, so
    that FDD images with odd sector sizes can work.
  - ROM BIOS now automatically occupies E8000-FFFFF instead
    of F0000-FFFFF when in PC-98 mode.
  - Most 128 byte/sector FDD images appear to jump to
    E800:0002. I'm guessing that's ROM BASIC, so add a
    callback at that location to catch these boot disks
    and show a message instead of allowing the boot
    sector to jump to nothing and crash.
  - PC-98 BOOT fixed to check for and support booting from
    FDD images where track 0 contains 128 byte/sector
    boot sectors.
  - PC-98 INT 1Bh support fixed to support reading/writing
    sector sizes other than the one sector size reported
    by the image. It is now possible to read the other
    sector sizes from an FDD/VFD image.
  - Fixed somewhat serious bug that, when compiled against
    Microsoft C++, causes the AVI writer to use the 32-bit
    lseek() function instead of the 64-bit lseek64() function.
    Prior to this fix, AVI captures would begin to corrupt
    themselves after growing past 2GB in size.
  - Cleanup code, fix compiler warnings, typecast problems,
    C/C++ conformance problems as reported by GCC 4.8,
    GCC 7.3.0 (MinGW), Visual Studio 2017, and Clang/LLVM
    on Mac OS X.
  - FM Towns machine type stub, for anyone interested in
    forking DOSBox-X to implement FM Towns emulation.
  - Code cleanup, refactor, according to compiler warnings.
  - SDL drawn menus fixed to copy Direct3D backbuffer to
    the SDL surface when popup occurs. This allows the
    menus to overlap the Direct3D display correctly.
  - Fixed Direct3D output so that when composing the next
    frame in the backbuffer, it also copies the SDL drawn
    menu from the SDL surface in order to keep it on
    screen.
  - Direct3D output updated to follow SDL clip rectangle
    struct, in the same exact manner as the OpenGL output.
    This also permits the Direct3D output to correctly size
    itself and leave space at the top for the SDL drawn
    menus.
  - Fixed dynamic core entry point to push/pop EBP because
    debug builds need the compiler to track the stack frame.
  - Updated in-tree zlib and libpng libraries to the latest
    provided by both projects.
  - Fixed VFD (FDD) disk image support to signal to FAT driver
    properly an error if it could not determine a geometry.
  - Fixed code breakage with SDL2 that prevented compilation
    with Munt (MT32) emulation enabled. SDL2 builds now allow
    MT32 emulation.
  - Mac OS X builds now compile against the in-tree zlib and
    libpng libraries for consistency.
  - MinGW builds now compile against the MinGW provided zlib
    and the in-tree libpng library for consistency.
  - Enabled MinGW builds to use Direct3D and Direct3D shaders.
  - Added code to auto-detect the VirtualBox display driver
    in Windows build, because OpenGL output doesn't work
    in Windows XP under VirtualBox. The change will switch
    the default output to "surface" if VirtualBox is detected,
    else will retain the "opengl" default. This change applies
    only to MinGW builds and not HX DOS or main VS2017 builds.
  - Added PC-98 INT DCh emulation for function call that
    writes a char to the screen, allowing Eve Burst Error
    to clear the function row
  - Added command line option to allow skipping the 1-second
    wait in the BIOS startup screen.
  - SDL2 builds now support use of the SDL drawn menu with
    a touchscreen device.
  - Fixed up SDL2 support code to compile correctly on
    Mac OS X.
  - Fixed up SDL2 compilation to automatically use the
    SDL2 library on the system, or if that is not available,
    use the SDL2 library in-tree. There are no plans to make
    modifications to the in-tree SDL2 code.
  - Added code to read and discard OpenGL error code before
    creating font texture, to avoid false failure handling.
    This fixes font rendering on Windows MinGW builds when
    output=opengl.
  - OpenGL SDL drawn menus fixed to ensure the menu contents
    have been redrawn at least twice. One for each OpenGL
    buffer because DOSBox-X uses the double-buffered mode.
  - SDL drawn menus implemented for output=opengl. The menu
    bar in Linux builds is now available in OpenGL mode.
  - SDL drawn menus fixed to redraw only when state changes,
    and to clean up menu drawing code.
  - US keyboards can now enter the "Ro" key in PC-98 mode.
    Default binding is set up to map the Windows Menu key
    as Ro in PC-98 mode.
  - VGA option change code fixed to trigger scaler redraw
    correctly. Changing video modes or changing between
    8/9-pixel VGA text no longer leaves artifacts on the
    screen.
  - Added code to force redrawing additional frames when
    output=opengl, in order to correct a bug with Linux/X11
    and MesaGL where the first OpenGL buffer swap after
    SDL_SetVideoMode() is misplaced when the window size
    changes.
  - Renderer SSE line comparison fixed to use correct sizeof()
    of the integer type during compare.
  - Renderer fixed not to use SSE and non-SSE line comparision
    at the same time, if SSE was enabled at compile time.
  - Fixed in-tree SDL 1.x library to allow DOSBox-X to disable
    auto-refresh of the window in Linux/X11 after SDL_SetVideoMode
    to prevent visible flickering when resizing the window.
  - Conditional support for Direct3D (9) output enabled for
    MinGW builds, if the MinGW headers are available (yksoft1).
    Option is disabled by default.
  - Configuration GUI dialog box widened to accomodate buttons
    that were previously cut off on the right.
  - Replace E_Exit() with LOG_MSG() for key codes from the mapper
    that a keyboard scan code generator does not recognize. This
    fixes E_Exit() crashes if typing certain keys on a Japanese
    keyboard with no equivalent in IBM PC/AT mode.
  - Added code to double the size of the menu and menu items if
    the window is 1280x800 or larger, for users with high
    definition laptop displays and screens.
  - Enforce minimum window size of 640x400 if the menu bar is
    visible and DOSBox-X is drawing them, to make sure the menus
    are accessible on screen.
  - Removed auto-scalar-size code when output=surface that was
    causing problems when resizing the window.
  - Do not show "screenshot" menu item if screenshot support not
    available at compile time.
  - Remove "always on top" for anything but Windows at this time.
  - Disable "Show debugger" option on Linux and Mac OS X if no
    console attached to STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR.
  - Disable "Show console" option on Linux and Mac OS X since
    the console is not under our control.
  - Windows "Always on top" fixed to remember selection and
    enforce it between SDL_SetVideoMode and fullscreen entry/exit.
  - Windows builds fixed NOT to change window Z-order on the
    screen when updating the window on SDL_SetVideoMode.
  - HX DOS builds fixed to keep window maximized at all times
    to fill the otherwise unused space on the screen since
    HXGUI only supports one window.
  - Menu framework support for any other platform (including
    Linux) added. The menus are drawn by DOSBox-X itself
    using the 8x16 VGA font. This also gives SDL 2.x builds
    a working menu. These menus are used if no other platform
    specific menus are available. These menus are NOT AVAILABLE
    at this time if output=opengl.
  - Cycle count edit dialog box fixed to immediately place
    keyboard focus in the text field, and to process
    ENTER and ESCAPE keyboard input as OK and CANCEL
    button input. You can type a new cycles count without
    having to click on the text field first.
  - Menu framework and mapper fixed so that menus always
    reflect the mapper binding in the menu.
  - Windows SDL 1.x fixed async hack to properly destroy
    and shut down the parent window again.
  - Fixed output=opengl crash on Mac OS X.
  - Menu framework support for Mac OS X NSMenu objects added.
    This gives DOSBox-X the same useful menu on Mac OS X
    instead of the useless default menu SDL 1.x offers.
  - Menu framework support for Windows win32 menu resources
    added. The Windows menu is now generated at runtime,
    the static IDR_MENU resource is no longer used.
  - New platform independent menu framework added. Menus
    that were once Windows-only are now available on
    any other platform including Linux and Mac OS X.
  - In-tree SDL 1.x library fixed to #define a special
    variable that the code now requires to compile
    SDL 1.x builds. The option to use your host SDL 2.x
    library is left open.
  - C++11 is now mandatory to compile DOSBox-X
0.82.6
  - Resizing the window in SDL 1.x Windows builds
    fixed to work correctly in the latest build
    (1803) of Windows 10. Prior to this fix, resizing
    the window on that build would quickly hit a deadlock
    that prevented the user from moving or resizing the
    window again after that point.
  - PC-98 dosbox.conf option added to select between
    accurate key/shift mapping, vs an alternate mapping
    appropriate for US keyboards (Yksoft1)
  - SDL 1.x for Linux/X11 modified to differentiate
    Ro and Yen keys despite X11 xkbmap apparently
    mapping both to the backslash. The keymap is
    queried to detect the scancodes at startup
    in order to return the correct SDLK constant.
  - SDL 1.x and DOSBox-X mapper code updated to
    correctly map Ro, Yen, @ ^ ; : keys on a JP
    keyboard in Windows and Linux.
  - PC-98 keyboard BIOS handling updated to generate
    ASCII codes according to PC-98 layout, instead
    of by US keyboard layout.
  - Mapper updated to support @ (at sign) key,
    ^ (caret) key, and a few other keys that
    exist on JP keyboards.
  - "Hold" modifier for mapper bindings fixed.
    It is now possible to tap the key again to
    release the hold.
  - VHD differencing disk support added (Shane32)
  - INT 18h AH=0Ah updated to support 20-line
    text mode. Some games use the 20-line text
    mode to space the text out vertically.
    Such games will display correctly now.
  - INT 18h now maintains text layer state
    in BIOS data area byte 0x53C, just as
    the actual BIOS does.
  - Added PC-98 INT 18h function AH=0Ah and
    AH=0Bh to support BIOS calls that enable
    "Simple Graphics" mode. This fixes
    problems with other games having vertical
    lines over the graphics, even though
    these games do not appear to use the
    simple graphics at all. (yksoft1)
  - Added support for PC-98 "Simple Graphics"
    mode of text layer attribute bit 4. When
    enabled, the attribute bit 4 changes
    meaning from vertical line to a bit
    indicating that the 8-bit character is
    a low resolution 2x4 bitmap to be
    displayed in the text layer. This fixes
    score and status display in Carat.
  - PC-98 INT 18h now implements AH=31h to
    report CRTC, text and graphics state and
    24khz/31khz video mode selection. This
    fix allows some games including Touhou
    Project to pace it's gameplay correctly
    in either video mode.
  - MinGW HX DOS builds default to host key
    F12 again
  - PC-98 mode now offers selection between
    24khz and 31khz video modes (yksoft1)
  - KEYB.COM fixed to load only the fonts the
    ROM BIOS has allocated. This fixes a guest
    system crash if using KEYB.COM with
    machine=ega
  - Moved host key to F11 for Windows. F12 is
    already taken by some internal debugging
    voodoo within Windows itself.
  - DOSBox-X codebase now strongly encourages
    compilation with C++11, will become
    required soon.
  - BOOT command fixed to make it possible to
    IMGMOUNT multiple floppies to drive 1, and
    boot from another disk in drive 0. This
    should enable the use of DOSBox-X with
    PC-98 games that expect to boot from drive
    A and the user to rotate through floppies
    in drive B.
  - IMGMOUNT fixed to support mounting with no
    filesystems and multiple disk images, and
    using the "swap floppy" command to rotate
    through them.
  - Added options to BOOT command that allows
    specifying multiple disk images and an option
    that says to swap disk images only through
    one drive.
  - VHD dynamic support added (shane32)
  - INT 10 AH=9 background color fixed in 256-color
    VGA modes.
  - Intro text updated to reflect new default
    key bindings.
  - Mapper shortcuts not in common use now exist
    without any default binding, and most existing
    default bindings are now associated with the
    "host" key.
  - Added 4th modifier "host" key to the mapper.
    This "host" key is F12 by default. The intent
    is to eventually move most mapper shortcuts
    to some combination of F12 and another key,
    rather than many shortcuts scattered over the
    keyboard. Existing dosbox mapper files should
    continue to work.
  - Renderer and 32bpp VGA display code fixed to
    reorder RGBA order for correct display on Intel
    Mac OS X systems. Mac OS X, on Intel systems,
    uses a strange BGRA 32bpp format that requires
    some adjustment on our part to display correctly.
  - Added more 24bpp INT 10h VESA BIOS modes.
  - Removed per-sector debug messages from VFD/FDD
    image support code.
0.82.5 (04/18/2018)
  - Expanded memory manager memory copy fixed to
    enable A20 gate temporarily so that the copy
    works correctly.
  - PC-98 FM board emulation now defaults to IRQ 12
    instead of IRQ 3. A lot of PC-98 games seem to
    have a strong preference for that IRQ with regard
    to FM music.
  - PC-98 reset I/O port (F0h) fixed to emulate CPU
    reset according to the SHUT0 and SHUT1 state set
    by the guest. Normally writing port F0h is a
    signal to reset but SHUT0 and SHUT1 can be set to
    indicate alternate behavior. This fixes VEMM486.EXE
    (an expanded memory manager) and allows it to run,
    since this manager appears to reset by port F0h
    then resume execution normally. Prior to this fix,
    booting a MS-DOS disk image that loads VEMM486.EXE
    at startup yielded nothing but an infinite reboot
    loop.
  - XMS and EMS emulation fixed not to leave A20 gate
    enabled unless EMS emulation is set to EMM386 and
    dosbox.conf is set to run the system in virtual
    8086 mode. There are plenty of DOS games that
    malfunction if loaded too low in memory with the
    A20 gate enabled.
  - PC-98 mouse emulation, at the 8255 level, now uses
    new C++ abstraction that seems to work fairly well
    even with the common PC-98 MOUSE.COM driver.
  - "BOOT" command in PC-98 mode updated to no longer
    require the --force switch. Booting MS-DOS from a
    hard disk or floppy disk image in PC-98 mode is
    generally functional now.
  - Added PC-98 SCSI/SASI hard disk emulation, and fixed
    BOOT to enable booting PC-98 MS-DOS from a hard drive
    (HDI image)
  - FAT driver fixed to read/write logical sectors vs
    actual drive sectors and removed geometry remapping
    hack.
  - FAT driver fixed to avoid memory corruption that
    may occur if reading a partition table from a drive
    that has more than 512 bytes/sector.
  - .BAT file parsing fixed to handle BAT files not
    in the current directory (yksoft1)
  - Fixed floppy controller emulation bug that failed
    to advance sectors during multi-sector read/write.
  - Fixed floppy emulation bug that prevented seeking.
    The "head" would get stuck at track 0 and never move.
  - Dynamic core allows running with paging enabled again,
    IF dosbox.conf says to allow it (yksoft1)
  - DOS file I/O functions AH=3Fh and AH=40h updated to
    reflect undocumented MS-DOS behavior that silently
    truncates read/written byte count if the offset
    and byte count reach beyond the end of a 64KB segment.
    This fixes some demoscene productions that read 64KB-1
    bytes but apparently rely on this behavior to avoid
    display errors.
  - FluidSynth fixes and API updates. DOSBox-X no longer
    uses a private API within FluidSynth. (heftig)
  - Added dosbox.conf option to control the size of the
    DOS "Swappable Data Area" which is said to help with
    shelling and task swapping in WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x
  - Added "minimum mcb free", and set minimum mcb segment to
    value same or similar to DOSBox SVN. The "free" option
    directs DOSBox-X to allocate memory before that segment
    value to fill memory.
  - Fixed COMMAND.COM PSP segment to correctly identify it's
    resident size in memory.
  - COMMAND.COM in the DOSBox shell now allocates itself
    normally instead of from a special segment so that it
    appears normally in the MCB allocation chain.
  - BIOS now clears it's stack before booting the DOS shell.
  - Fix Pause (CTRL+Pause or ALT+Pause) to release all keys
    in the mapper so that CTRL, ALT, or Shift are not left
    "stuck" when emulation resumes.
  - Initial host keyboard recognition, and base framework
    for general keyboard language/layout handling. Keyboard
    layout recognition added for Windows and Linux/X11.
  - Fixed 350-line INT 10h VESA modes not to apply EGA mode
    adjustments, which fixes display distortion.
  - INT 10h VESA modes 720x480 and 848x480 fixed.
  - Fixed INT 10h VESA emulation to round up bytes/scanline
    so that 4bpp planar modes display properly.
  - Fixed INT 10h VESA mode 1400x1050 16-color (4bpp planar)
    mode to resolve overlapping mode number.
  - Pulled in VGA vtotal + 2 fix from DOSBox SVN
  - Pulled in EGA display mode fixes from DOSBox SVN to fix
    EGA graphics emulation.
  - Fixed INT 10h AH=1Ch (save/restore VGA state) to handle
    VGA attribute controller properly so that the display is
    not left blank.
  - PC-98 GDC emulation fixed to handle START DISPLAY properly
    by un-blanking the display (fixes "Ellena")
  - Fixed possible format string vulnerabilities (gnustomp)
  - Added menu options to enable/disable EGC and GRCG
    emulation (yksoft1)
  - Added options to enable/disable EGC and GRCG emulation
    (to emulate older hardware).
  - Added PC-98 BIOS function to read 8x16 character bitmaps,
    which fixes "Power Dolls 2"
  - BIOS now reports 16-color and EGC graphics. Some games
    that check the BIOS for capabilities may now begin to
    use 16-color graphics and EGC functions.
  - Added PC-98 INT 18h function to read character font.
    This also resolves garbled text in TH01.
  - PC-98 GDC emulation now uses cursor specification
    (line per character row) to determine whether graphics
    are doubled vertically or not. Several PC-98 games
    switch between 200-line (doubled) and 400-line graphics
    by programming the GDC directly, rather than through
    the BIOS.
  - Added various video-related BIOS variables to the data
    in PC-98 mode.
  - GDC RESET/SYNC debug text updated to indicate which GDC
    is undergoing the RESET/SYNC.
  - Debugger "LOG" command (CPU execution logging) fixed to
    automatically stop logging when the BIOS begins the
    POST routine after system reset. The user who invoked
    "LOG" probably cares more about what happened up to the
    game crash, fault and reset rather than normal BIOS startup.
  - BIOS now properly unmasks the PC-98 cascade IRQ, which
    allows IRQ 8-15 to function, including the mouse (IRQ13)
  - Debugger interface now indicates whether 80386 paging is
    enabled or not at any time.
  - Help text updates to reflect DOSBox-X changes (Shane32)
  - BIOS INT 13h emulation updated to support up to 4 hard
    drives (Shane32)
  - IMGMOUNT and BOOT code cleanup (Shane32)
  - IMGMOUNT RAM drive support: Additional fixes and geometry
    work done, and some hangs resolved (Shane32)
  - CPU emulation fixed to allow setting a breakpoint on
    ANY interrupt of a specific number, not just software
    interrupts. It is now possible to use BPINT to break
    upon hardware (IRQ) interrupts.
  - DOS kernel fixed to drop to the debugger if the MCB
    (memory control block) chain is corrupted, so that
    the corrupted state can be examined. When the debugger
    continues execution, a full restart of the DOS kernel
    is run. If DOSBox-X was compiled without the debugger,
    then the normal E_Exit() path is still taken.
  - Added debugger command to show, and modify, the state
    of the PIC (interrupt controller).
  - Added debugger command to view or change the A20 gate.
  - Added debugger command to view the state of EMS, memory
    handles, allocation, and EMS page frame mapping.
  - Added debugger command to view the state of XMS, memory
    handles, and allocation.
  - Added debugger command to view the layout of the ROM
    BIOS region (0xF0000-0xFFFFF) chosen by emulation.
  - DOS kernel now logs kernel allocations, which can be
    seen in the debugger using the "DOS KERN" command.
  - Added "RUN" command as an alternative to hitting F5.
  - Added "RUNWATCH" to the debugger, so that watching the
    system run in the debugger is possible.
  - Debugger data window can now be used to view memory in
    segmented, virtual (through paging), and physical (bus
    address) modes.
  - Debugger window data and code view windows now indicate
    regions of memory that are beyond the end of the segment.
  - Debugger window data and code view windows now indicate
    regions of memory that are paged out (will cause a page
    fault if accessed)
  - PC-98 A20 gate I/O port F6h fixed to work properly as an
    enable or disable, rather than just an enable. The PC-98
    version of HIMEM.SYS no longer complains about not being
    able to control the A20 gate.
  - IMGMOUNT RAM drive support: Ramdrive bug fixes and changed
    drive limits from ATA limits to BIOS/MBR (Shane32)
  - INT 21h fixed to use BIOS INT 1Ch to read date and time in
    PC-98 mode. Arrowgun now runs properly.
  - Fixed EMS emulation not to claim XMS memory (and zero BIOS
    extended memory size) if EMS emulation is in EMS board mode
    (and therefore not allocating extended memory through HIMEM.SYS).
  - PC-98 INT 1Fh extended memory copy implemented. DOS games in
    PC-98 mode can now use this API to access extended memory.
  - Fixed HIMEM.SYS emulation in PC-98 mode to zero BIOS extended
    memory values when claiming extended memory.
  - PC-98 mode now sets BIOS data area values correctly regarding
    conventional and extended memory.
  - Added rudimentary emulation of non-volatile RAM at the
    trailing edge of text RAM (A3FE0-A3FFF).
  - PC-98 mode now adds additional BIOS data values at boot time
    so that guest OSes like PC-98 MS-DOS can see the floppy drive,
    see keyboard input, and determine the boot drive properly.
    It is now possible to boot MS-DOS in PC-98 mode.
  - Added rudimentary PC-98 INT 1Bh BIOS interrupt, at least for
    floppy disk emulation.
  - Cleanup and formatting enhancements to IMGMOUNT ramdisk (Shane32)
  - DOS CON emulation in PC-98 mode now emulates two additional
    ANSI escapes to clear the screen that are specific to NEC's
    MS-DOS implementation, which fixes text layer problems with
    Rusty.
  - PC-98 GDC dip switch 2-8 emulation fixed. It was backwards.
    This may break existing dosbox.conf configurations, apologies
    in advance.
  - Added -xms option to LOADFIX command. When given, the command
    consumes extended memory instead of conventional memory.
  - HIMEM.SYS emulation fixed to behave more like Microsoft's
    HIMEM.SYS implementation regarding global & local A20 gate
    control.
  - Mac OS X builds fixed to work from the user's home directory
    if run from the Finder, instead of trying to operate at the
    root of the filesystem as directed by the Finder.
  - Mac OS X builds now put the FREECG98.BMP file inside of the
    .app bundle, and fall back to it if not found in the current
    directory.
  - RPM builds now install FREECG98.BMP in /usr/share/dosbox-x
    and refer to it if not in your local directory, in order to
    better provide PC-98 emulation.
  - PC-98 BOOT command: Loading addresses and CPU register layout
    updated to match actual hardware behavior, in which the boot
    sector is loaded at just under 128KB.
  - Build updates to support compiling for Windows with MinGW.
  - BOOT now accepts a --debug switch that causes DOSBox-X to break into
    the debugger when the boot sector begins to execute.
  - BOOT now accepts a --force switch to override the PC-98 lockout,
    if the user wants to better understand why I locked it out in PC-98 mode.
  - PC-98 support now supports reading font from FONT.ROM, if available.
  - Code, data, and output now respond to arrow, page up/down and
    home/end keys as a user would normally expect.
  - Arrow and page up/down keyboard input now goes to active window
    instead of mapping directly to any specific window.
  - Debugger interface now has the concept of an "active" window, and
    the title bar of each window hilights if it is active.
  - Debugger interface now hides the "variables" window by default.
  - Fixed window "titles" in debugger interface to fill the terminal
    line they're on and use ncurses horizontal line character which
    on modern systems looks better than hyphens.
  - Removed one line padding around data window in debugger interface.
  - Debugger interface redesigned to permit more flexible layout
  - Debugger interface no longer crashes when terminal window is sized
    down too small (when there is no room for the output window)
  - EMM386 (ems) emulation fixed to always turn on the A20 gate when
    the DOS application requests to map pages into the EMS page frame.
    This fixes crashes with Creative's Sound Blaster 16 installer when
    run with the A20 gate turned off.
0.82.4 (02/28/2018)
  - Updated ramdisk formatting code to better match FAT12/FAT16
    specifications and limits (Shane32)
  - Menu items related to Gravis Ultrasound, Glide emulation, Innova SID,
    and other IBM PC-specific options are now grayed out in PC-98 mode.
  - Updated Windows menus to gray out CPU core and type options that
    are invalid. Selecting a prefetch CPU type while core dynamic is
    no longer possible, and selecting dynamic core while using a
    prefetch cpu type is no longer possible.
  - CPU type submenu in Windows updated to reflect all types supported
    by DOSBox-X including 8086 and 286 cores.
  - Fixed E_Exit() crash on Windows in PDCurses endwin() that only
    happens if you had never brought up the debugger console window.
  - Minor oddities with OPNA stereo panning resolved.
  - Sound Blaster, Adlib, and PC-98 FM emulation now reset state
    correctly when the reset signal is given to avoid stuck notes.
  - Fixed BIOS logo in PC-98 mode to properly reset the graphics mode
    so that the logo is visible.
  - Added Windows menu items to control PC-98 GDC speed, 4-partition enable,
    200-line "scanline" effect enable, and PIT timer clock control.
  - Added "Restart DOS" command to the Windows menu, with code to
    allow it only if at the initial DOS shell.
  - Added "multi-track WAV" command to the Windows menu, under Capture
  - Added "reset system" command to the Windows menu
  - "Restart" menu command updated to clarify that it restarts DOSBox-X entirely.
  - OpenGL HQ output removed.
  - Commands to force driver (DirectX or WINDIB) removed.
  - Default disk I/O limit raised to more reasonable speeds.
  - FM code borrowed from Neko Project II now compiles on Mac OS X
  - IMGMOUNT now supports mounting a RAM drive (using -t ram) (Shane32)
  - Direct3D fullscreen aspect ratio fixes, especially for
    monitors with a 5:4 aspect ratio (such as 1280x1024) (Shane32)
  - "Show menu" in Windows builds system menu is now a toggle
    to show/hide the menu bar (Shane32)
  - Fixed broken color palette with CGA composite and EGA
    machine emulation. Composite CGA and machine=ega displays
    properly again.
  - According to documentation, IBM PC and PC-98 use different
    initial PC speaker frequencies. Update the code to match.
  - 8254 I/O port alias at 3FD9h-3FDFh added, which is needed
    for several PC-98 games that program the PC speaker
    frequency through those ports instead of through 71h-77h
  - New Intel 8255 emulation. PC-98 system 8255 emulation
    now uses this emulation, along with PC speaker emulation.
  - Fixed XMS memory copy functions to enable the A20
    gate so extended memory copies work correctly whether
    or not the DOS application in question made the call
    with A20 enabled. This fixes crashes and memory
    corruption while installing Windows 3.1 using SETUP.EXE.
  - "CLS" now sends the proper ANSI escapes to clear the
    console in PC-98 mode.
  - BIOS logo in PC-98 fixed to clear graphics RAM and
    set graphics back to 8-color digital mode when booting
    to DOS. This should fix palette errors and color issues
    with older PC-98/PC-88 games that use the 8-color
    graphics modes.
  - Added PC-98 INT 1Ch timer interval BIOS function,
    and timer countdown routine in IRQ 0.
  - Windows builds now incorporate pdcurses and enable
    the debugger interface (bulletshot60)
  - DOSBox-X now tracks the systemwide keyboard layout
    on Windows, and acts on user changes to the keyboard
    and language in the system.
  - Removed hack code in SDL 1.x that sets DOSBox-X's
    keyboard layout to the US layout even if the host
    uses anything else.
  - Fix CPU cycles count increment not to nag you to use
    core=dynamic if a) dynamic core is not available or
    b) you're already using dynamic core.
  - Added dynamic core back, it seems to be very stable
    again.
  - PC-98 FM board now allows changing the base I/O port
    and IRQ (interrupt) line used by the card.
  - PC-98 mode now supports joystick emulation. Joystick
    input is mapped through the DOSBox mapper to the
    PC-98 FM board where DOS games expect to see it.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to select which PC-98 FM
    board to emulate.
  - Fixed PC-98 FM code to enable the ADPCM and Rhythm
    FM channels.
  - Re-ported Neko Project II FM board emulation, this
    time keeping the code intact and keeping the separate
    board emulations intact for PC-98 mode.
  - VGA palette errors with Crystal Dream II fixed.
  - PC-98 FM synthesis fixed not to initialize itself
    again when rebooting, which fixes a problem with
    garbled FM synthesis after rebooting.
  - Removed some now-unnecessary SDL Video quit/init
    calls from Windows builds.
  - machine=pc98 now starts entire emulation in PC-98
    mode instead of booting up in IBM PC mode and
    switching to PC-98 mode.
  - Initial "BIOS" startup screen now operates in
    PC-98 mode when machine=pc98.
  - Prefetch core debug code now disabled at compile
    time. Seems to be stable so far.
  - Prefetch core now emulates partial load of the
    prefetch buffer on miss, and completing the buffer
    fill on hit, to better emulate (probable) 80486
    behavior.
  - 486_prefetch is now a valid cputype setting, despite
    the setting having existed for years in the source
    code. Prior to this fix, 486_prefetch was ignored.
0.82.3 (02/13/2018)
  - Removed DOSBox SVN-style "fast" A20 gate emulation.
    Recent changes make it infeasible to keep. "fast" is
    now mapped to "mask" mode.
  - RAM aliasing is now always on, even if memalias is not
    set, in order to help enforce A20 gate behavior, and
    to fix emulator crashes when a non-aliased RAM page
    is referenced through an alias.
  - Cleanup and rewrite of prefetch core, to make the code
    cleaner and more readable and maintainable.
  - DOS file I/O updated to apply a proper delay rather
    than the old DOSBox SVN code's cycle count dependent
    method. The delay by default will slow disk I/O down
    to mid 1990's IDE PIO speeds, which can resolve issues
    with MS-DOS demoscene or game executables that can
    malfunction when disk I/O is too fast.
  - PIC code updated to enforce a proper IRQ delay on ALL
    IRQ signals, which fixes issues with MS-DOS executables
    that have race conditions between their code and their
    interrupt handlers.
  - DOS Shell now shows the full intro text only at first
    run, instead of every shell invocation.
  - Use FCB record size of 128 bytes if the FCB record size
    is zero (from DOSBox SVN).
  - PC speaker fix not to generate a continuous tone if
    the PIT timer was set to mode 0. This fixes issues with
    many early 1990s demoscene executables leaving the PC
    speaker enabled (BEEEEEEP).
  - Register DEBUGBOX.COM at DOS environment start instead
    of boot, which allows the command to work again.
  - EXE loader sets stack pointer (SS:SP) into PSP segment
    (from DOSBox SVN)
  - EXE loader fixed to use the larger of the minimum and
    maximum memory sizes listed in the EXE header, which
    fixes some demoscene executables with a minimum size
    larger than maximum.
  - VGA DAC (palette) emulation updated to better match
    actual SVGA chipset (Paradise SVGA) behavior, which
    fixes some VGA palette errors in some demoscene
    productions.
  - Added -nocachedir option to internal MOUNT command, to
    disable directory caching for a local folder mounted
    to a drive letter. When mounted this way, changes on
    the host filesystem are immediately visible in the
    guest DOS environment.
  - Added -ro and -rw options to internal MOUNT command, to
    allow mounting local folders to a drive letter as a
    read-only volume.
  - MIDI Fluidsynth fixed to initialize and free state properly
    so that switching to and from Fluidsynth doesn't cause
    a segfault or crash.
  - MPU-401 fixed to allow changes to MIDI configuration from
    CONFIG.COM.
  - DOS filename handling fixed to maintain ASCII conversion
    to uppercase, while not converting Shift-JIS double-byte
    characters in PC-98 mode. This fixes Shift-JIS filename
    corruption when the trailing byte can be mistaken for
    lowercase ASCII a to z.
  - Windows fixes to keep menu bar items updated with
    DOSBox-X state.
  - Remove WM_DROPFILES handling, for now. The code remains
    to allow re-enabling later.
  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to process only WM_COMMAND (menu
    bar) and WM_SYSCOMMAND (system menu) events so that
    the general chatter in modern Windows system does not
    drown out the messages. This fixes issues where the
    menu bar doesn't work on some systems.
  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to handle menu bar input using
    SDL's WM events instead of fighting with SDL's message
    pump to receive menu events. This fixes potential
    issues with losing menu bar events.
  - dosbox.conf reference included with Windows builds
    now uses MS-DOS line endings so that the file can be
    edited in NOTEPAD.EXE
  - New dosbox.conf option to control whether the menu is
    shown by default in Windows builds.
  - titlebar= SDL dosbox.conf option, to allow showing a more
    user friendly name for the program instead of just using
    the EXE name.
  - E_Exit() on Windows now displays the message using
    MessageBox() in addition to sending to STDERR, so that
    Windows users see the error even if they are running
    it from the desktop instead of the command line.
  - PC-98 EGC bit shifter emulation fixed to correctly support
    ascending and descending bit shifting in either direction.
    This fixes screen shake emulation errors with Touhou Project
    TH04 and TH05.
  - Linux/X11 fixes to SDL 1.x to better match and compare
    Visuals (descriptions of the screen) since X11 libraries
    don't seem to use the same pointer values for the same
    Visuals.
  - ALT+TAB or loss of focus from fullscreen in Windows now
    restores the window instead of minimizing it.
  - 3Dfx OpenGL will hide the minimize and maximize buttons
    in Windows while active.
  - Windows menu bar items are now grayed out when 3Dfx OpenGL
    emulation is active (items that cannot be used at that time).
  - Fix Windows system menu to always keep "show menu".
  - GFX rendering fixed not to render any output while 3Dfx
    OpenGL emulation is active.
  - 3Dfx OpenGL bug fixes to properly restore the DOS console
    when the 3Dfx card is de-initialized and the game returns
    to the DOS prompt.
  - Linux/X11 window output fixed to keep the window on the
    screen even when switching between OpenGL and non-OpenGL,
    and when setting the SDL video mode.
  - Remove some init hacks and SDL forced reinitialized hacks,
    so that the window is stable on the screen.
  - Added code to do more OpenGL state initialization (both
    output=opengl and when initializing 3Dfx OpenGL emulation)
    to make more consistent output.
  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation fixed to switch out of
    fullscreen mode IF DOSBox-X was fullscreen at the time the
    card is initialized.
  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation no longer allows fullscreen
    mode, and does everything it can to prevent window resizing.
  - Linux/X11 disable XRandR, XV, and X modeset functions. Do not
    change monitor resolution.
  - MPU-401 MIDI emulation fixed to look at all conductor message
    bytes for code 0xFC (ALL END) instead of just the first byte.
    This fixes hangs in games that send additional bytes prior to
    0xFC and then expect the MPU-401 to signal 0xFC back when the
    games are waiting for music to stop.
  - Fix DOS CON driver not to signal data ready for PC-98 scan
    codes that have no corresponding ANSI code. Tapping numeric
    keypad keys during the title screen in Touhou Project should
    no longer cause the game to pause waiting for keyboard input
    when going into demo mode.
  - Fix DOS CON driver to signal data ready for buffered escape
    code.
  - Fix PC-98 keyboard emulation not to apply IBM PC "extended"
    keyboard scancode filtering.
  - Window maximization does not count as a user resize preference.
  - Fix Windows builds to enable DirectSerial, Direct LPT, modem,
    emulation.
  - New mapper shortcut to restore the window's original size.
  - Fix bug with SHL instruction and OF flag, which corrects some
    games and their decompression routines.
  - Fullscreen (monitor) modesetting removed. DOSBox-X either runs
    in a window, or scales up to fill the monitor, but will not change
    the monitor resolution.
  - Resize handling fixed to differentiate user resize verses resize
    caused by DOSBox-X changing the window dimensions.
  - Linux/X11 fixes to avoid flickering when resizing the window, and
    to avoid redrawing unless necessary.
  - Window resize management, to scale/arrange the output to fit the
    window (for output= surface, opengl, direct3d)
  - Enable resizing again, except when the GUI or mapper is active.
  - Fix Linux/X11 to always take resize events, instead of ignoring
    all further resize events just because one resize event is forever
    "pending"
  - Linux/X11 builds now track the size of the window on the desktop,
    to keep track of resizing and maximizing.
0.82.2 (01/29/2018)
  - Linux builds no longer enable window resizing. The ability to
    resize will be added back when the emulator can better handle
    the user resizing the window.
  - Windows and Linux now have synchronized build date and version
    strings.
  - Codebase begin transition to C++11
  - The Windows maximize button no longer triggers fullscreen mode.
  - Direct3D, OpenGL, and Surface outputs updated to fill the window
    in Windows builds when the window is maximized. If aspect
    correction is enabled, the Direct3D and OpenGL outputs will
    scale the DOS screen (with pillarbox/letterbox padding) to the
    correct aspect ratio and center within the maximized window.
  - Fixed minor memory leak in MT32 (MUNT) synthesizer usage.
  - Fixed uninitialized state issues with DMA channel 4 (cascade).
  - IMGMOUNT now allows mounting the El Torito bootable floppy image
    of a CD-ROM drive as a drive letter and accessible (read only)
    filesystem. The FAT filesystem driver was fixed to support working
    from sources other than a direct file.
  - PC-98 mode fixed not to register certain built-in commands and
    binaries to drive Z:\ that are not compatible with PC-98 mode.
    MEM.EXE in particular uses IBM PC-specific techniques to gather
    it's information, and is therefore incompatible with PC-98 mode.
    This can be verified from the source code as MEM.EXE was evidently
    borrowed from the FreeDOS project.
  - EGA emulation (machine=ega) fixed to render 8bpp (256-color mode)
    instead of full 32bpp VGA output. EGA video output is limited to
    64-color (6-bit) by the design of the video connector (2-bit R/G/B)
    therefore the full precision of 32bpp is not needed. This will also
    benefit video capture as the reduced color bit depth will result
    in smaller AVI files when recording gameplay.
  - Added code to correctly detect 15-bit highcolor vs 16-bit highcolor
    display format support, despite SDL falsely indicating 16-bit
    color in both cases, which fixes incorrect colors on 15-bit display
    modes.
  - Fix up VGA DAC/palette mapping to display the emulator screen
    properly on 16-bit true color displays. Fixed off-by-one shift
    mistake in the DOSBox-X render scaler code that caused
    green and purple tints to colors on 16-bit true color displays.
  - Add "Show menu bar" command to the Windows "system menu" so that
    the menu bar can be brought back after selecting "hide menu bar".
  - Losing window focus while fullscreen no longer leaves the emulator
    window blank.
  - Maximize/restore fullscreen cleanup.
  - Removed DDRAW output.
  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to clear "success" flag at all failure
    return points. This fixes problems where unrecognizeable FAT
    filesystems are nonetheless presented as a drive letter with
    garbled filenames, when IMGMOUNT should have displayed an error
    instead.
  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to allow PC-98 HDI images to load that
    have headcount == 0 in the BPB.
  - Fix Adlib emulation not to register a mapper handler if emulation
    will jump to PC-98 mode, and fix mapper handler to check if Adlib
    emulation is loaded to avoid segfault.
  - Add "recording" volume to control the loudness of the audio going
    out to capture (WAV, AVI, etc.)
  - Separate mixer rendering from master volume. Apply master volume
    at the sound card only, leave audio at full volume for recording
    (WAV, AVI, etc. capture).
  - dosbox.conf and command line option to log CON driver output to
    a file. Anything written to STDOUT/CON by a DOS application is
    logged this way.
  - --time-limit <n> command line option to put a time limit on the
    emulator, in seconds.
  - Keyboard shortcut for the mapper UI no longer leaves keys "stuck"
    in the guest to cause problems when you exit the mapper UI.
  - Fixed code mistake that caused OpenGL NB output when dosbox.conf
    specified output=opengl
  - Mapper layout fixes:
    - Shortcut buttons (on the right hand side of the UI) fixed to
      become two columns wide if the button text won't fit in one
      column.
    - Some shortcut button titles shortened.
  - Mapper UI updated to show which bindings are being activated by
    hilighting buttons in the UI.
  - Mapper UI modifier buttons indicate status through hilighting.
  - Mapper UI joystick buttons and axes now use hilighting to indicate
    that there is input from the device.
  - Mapper fix for 4-axis joysticks that may count zero buttons, and
    then crash (divide by zero) when the user pushes a button on the
    joystick device.
  - BIOS emulation now allows you to specify binary blobs to execute
    in the guest system as part of startup. One can be specified to
    execute just after CPU reset/power-on, and the other just before
    booting to the DOS shell. THE BINARY BLOBS EXECUTE IN THE GUEST
    ENVIRONMENT AND NOT AS ARBITRARY CODE ON YOUR HOST. This option
    is provided for both automated testing and for the curious who
    may want to venture into low level ASM hacking.
  - INTRO.COM fixed to accept keyboard input correctly in both
    PC-98 and IBM PC mode. You can now browse the help text properly
    in either mode.
  - DOS shell fixed to accept DOSKEY-like input in both IBM PC and
    PC-98 mode (including arrow keys, F3, tab completion, etc.)
  - DOS CON emulation now provides function keys (F1-F10) in PC-98 mode.
  - DOS CON emulation fixed to process PC-98 BIOS codes and generate
    PC-98 ANSI escapes as real hardware normally does.
  - Mapper no longer shows two sets of the shortcuts (one overlaid
    over the keyboard), registration bug fixed.
  - PC-98 keyboard interrupt handler now handles CTRL key and
    passes most keys as-is down through INT 18h now.
  - Removed non-recursive page fault option. It is now always on,
    except for internal cases where it needs to be off for callback
    instructions to do their work properly.
  - Removed dynamic x86 core. It is old and unmaintained code that
    is incompatible with the non-recursive page fault system.
  - IRQ cascade interrupt fixes and cleanup.
  - BAT files given on the command line fixed to occur AFTER the
    registration of ULTRASND and BLASTER environment variables.
  - PC-98: DOS CON emulation fixed to decode Shift-JIS itself,
    with consideration that some proprietary double-byte encodings
    yield single-wide characters. DOS program using NEC's proprietary
    box/line drawing characters this way should display properly now.
  - DOSBox shell "greeting" now displays a proper box in PC-98 mode
    instead of framing the text in rows and columns of Katakana. (basic2004)

0.82.1 (12/25/2017)
  - Windows builds no longer redirect stdout and stderr to
    stdout.txt and stderr.txt. This also fixes problems
    with crashing or hanging when run from Program Files.
  - Windows releases compiled by TheGreatCodeholio again.
  - SDL 1.x and SDL 2.x support in the same branch, selectable
    by configuration option or VS2017 build target.
  - SC400 emulation fixes
  - Mac OS X pixel format fix to avoid corrupt graphics (Martin Lindhe)
  - MT32 emulation now explains what ROM images it's looking for,
    instead of just stating that it can't find the ROM images.
  - Direct3D shaders from Daum (alex)
  - NukeOPL OPL emulation
  - Basic (experimental) NEC PC-98 emulation (machine=pc98)
    - CG (character generator) emulation will need ANEX86.BMP
      or FREECG98.BMP
  - Some uninitialized state fixes
  - FDI, FDD floppy disk support (especially PC-98 games)
  - HDI hard disk support (especially PC-98 games)
  - DOS FAT filesystem driver: added many sanity, size,
    sector size and overrun checks.
  - Floppy and hard disk image support now supports sector
    sizes other than 512 bytes per sector (up to 1024).
  - DOS FAT filesystem driver can now handle FAT filesystems
    formatted with 256, 512, or 1024 bytes per sector.

    IBM PC MBR (master boot record) and PC-98 IPL1 partition
    tables.
  - Fixed UMB memory selection not to overlap the EMS page frame.
  - EMS updated to sit at E000h in IBM PC mode and D000h in PC-98 mode.
  - Mapper interface now shows additional buttons for handlers
    registered after initial emulator setup phase.
  - Mapper fixed to load/save or apply default keybindings for
    handlers registered after initial emulator setup phase.
  - Mapper fixes now reveal "capture OPL", "hercules palette"
    options as well. The fixes also allow the default key
    bindings for those functions to work.
  - "CTTY NUL" no longer causes DOSBox-X to hang.
  - MOUNT now supports use of -q to suppress message when
    successfully unmounting a drive.
