0.83.13
  - DOSBox-X can now resolve file paths in its config
    options that include environment variables on non-
    Windows platforms (e.g. ${HOME}..) as well. A new
    config option "resolve config path" (in [dosbox]
    section) is added to control path resolving in the
    config file (e.g. to resolve tildes only by setting
    to "tilde", or disable all path resolving). (Wengier)
  - System menu text in Windows builds now match the text
    in the drop-down menus to be translatable. (Wengier)
  - The error "Access Denied" is returned instead of
    "File not found" for files opened exclusively in
    another program on mounted local drives. (Wengier)
  - S386C928 hardware cursor fixed to divide X coordinate
    by bytes per pixel indicated in the control register
    to match apparent Windows 3.1/95 behavior. Cursor
    now tracks host properly even in highcolor/truecolor
    modes.
  - Added support for the RetroWave OPL3 hardware player.
    Set "oplemu=retrowave_opl3" in [sblaster] section of
    the config file to use it. Config options including
    "retrowave_bus", "retrowave_spi_cs", "retrowave_port"
    are added to adjust its settings. (ClassicOldSong)
  - Added support for S386C928 hardware cursor color
    selection in 256-color mode, which is different
    from later cards.
  - S3 XGA "BYTE SWP" fixed only to byte swap if the
    transfer is 16-bit wide. This fixes the dither
    pattern drawn by Windows 95/98 when you select
    "Shutdown" from the Start menu.
  - IMGMAKE command is now disabled in the secure mode,
    similar to commands like IMGMOUNT. (Wengier)
  - Added config options "working directory option" and
    "working directory default" in [dosbox] section of
    the config file to provide various options for the
    users to control DOSBox-X's working directory. For
    example, DOSBox-X can use the primary config file
    directory or the DOSBox-X program directory as its
    working directory. You can view the DOSBox-X'safe
    working directory with CONFIG -L command. DOSBox-X
    is also able to save the working directory that a
    user selects to global config files. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now also try to read the config file
    named dosbox-x.conf in the user config directory
    when searching for config files at start.
  - Added new command-line options -promptfolder and
    -nopromptfolder which will cause the folder prompt
    dialogs to show or not to show at startup.
  - Mac OS X builds will prompt the user to select a
    folder at startup if run from the Finder (or from
    the root directory). The folder selected will then
    become the current working directory of DOSBox-X.
    This makes it possible to start DOSBox-X with a
    config file of your choice and to control where
    the capture, save states and other files go.
  - Fixed Tseng ET4000 640x480 256-color SVGA mode
    when using the ET4000.BIN VGA BIOS, or Windows 98.
  - Added segment limit checks in Normal core for
    MOVSB/MOVSW/MOVSD and STOSB/STOSW/STOSD, which is
    needed for DOSBox-X to work with the Windows 3.1
    S3 86C928 display drivers that use segment limit
    exceptions to fake a linear framebuffer.
  - Added S3 XGA "byte swap" emulation, needed for
    correct menu/titlebar display in Windows 3.1 when
    using the S3 86C928 driver.
  - Added YUV (YUY2) overlay to S3 Trio64V+ card
    emulation. Tested with XingMPEG under Windows 3.1
    and ActiveMovie under Windows 98.
  - Added machine types for 5 different variations of
    S3 chipset: Vision864, Vision868, Trio32, Trio64,
    and (experimental) Trio64V+, ViRGE, ViRGE/VX, and
    S3 86C928.
  - Removed second PCI BAR for S3 MMIO register space.
    S3 datasheets do not show a second BAR. Windows 95
    is perfectly happy without it.
  - S3 SVGA XGA emulation BlitRect now supports
    COLOR_CMP. DirectX-based Windows 95 games are now
    able to blit in 256-color mode with a transparent
    color key value.
  - ANSI.SYS emulaion now supports the "Device Status
    Report" escape when asked through code 6 (report
    cursor position)
  - Fixed RAM mapping bugs related to MDA/CGA/Hercules
    emulation and the "allow more than 640kb" option,
    that failed to map RAM as expected, and because of
    that, easily triggered a "corrupt MCB chain" error
    message.
  - Worked around the mounting issue for disk or CD
    image files with LaunchBox, by allowing a mounting
    command-line with single quotes like IMGMOUNT D
    'X:\FILES\DOS.IMG' on Windows systems. (Wengier)
  - Restored Pentium MMX emulation code for the dynamic
    x86 core to that of version 0.83.11 for better
    compatibility with some Windows 9x games. (Wengier)
  - Added "compresssaveparts" config option (in the
    [dosbox] section) which when set to false will not
    compress the components in saved states. (Wengier)
  - When the current reported DOS version is less than
    7.x and the user tries to mount a LBA or FAT32 disk
    image, DOSBox-X will now show a message to ask if
    the user wants it to set the required DOS version
    automatically and proceed. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now show the folder mounted after
    mounting to a drive from the menu. (Wengier)
  - Fixed MOUNT and IMGMOUNT commands unable to mount
    directories or image files that contain non-ASCII
    characters in the code page on Windows. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the cycle information on the title bar when
    the Turbo mode is enabled. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that some games using the DOS4GW Extender
    may not work due to swap file issue. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that the clipboard copy and paste may not
    work when the current code page is 808 or 872
    and you are using Windows. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the handling of the "Save & Restart" button
    in Configuration Tool when using Direct3D output
    in Windows SDL2 builds. (Wengier)
  - Fixed incorrect display issue when using TrueType
    font (TTF) output with customized screen dimension
    when fastbioslogo=true is set. (Wengier)
  - Fixed CD audio not looping for individual tracks
    in games like Alien Trilogy. (kcgen)
  - The command "MIXER /LISTMIDI" now lists the ROM
    directory/files and sound fonts for MT32, Synth
    and FluidSynth MIDI device when active. (Wengier)
  - Debugger "DOS XMS" command will only list handles
    that are allocated, or with nonzero address or
    nonzero size, to avoid showing irrelevant
    information. (joncampbell123)
  - Added LOADFIX -EMS option to allocate/free
    EMS (expanded memory). (joncampbell123)
  - LOADFIX -D -XMS will free all XMS blocks
    allocated by LOADFIX -XMS. (joncampbell123)
  - LOADFIX -A will not allocate memory unless there
    is memory below 64KB to fill. (joncampbell123)
  - INT 15h PS/2 mouse functions now clear pending
    PS/2 mouse interrupt as part of the BIOS call.
    This should resolve unresponsive mouse issues
    with Windows 3.1. (joncampbell123)
  - Add config option "mt32.model" in the [midi]
    section to force a MT-32 model to use. (Wengier)
  - Updated the MUNT MT-32 library to the latest
    version 2.5.0. (Wengier)
  - Updated FLAC decoder library to the latest version
    (0.12.29 by David Reid). (Wengier)
  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)
    - r4436, r4437: Rewrite store integer instructions
    to check if the result fits.(vogons 78127)
    - r4447: Attribute Controller port alias on EGA
    machine. Fixes EGA display of older Super Pac-Man
    release.
0.83.12
  - Tandy graphics emulation fixed to accept 8 bits
    for vertical total and vertical display CRTC
    registers, which is needed for the tweaked
    graphics mode used by Math Rabbit to display
    correctly.
  - INT 10h will no longer fill in three fields in
    the BIOS data area (video CTL, char height, and
    video switches) unless the machine type is
    EGA or VGA. Those fields do not exist otherwise.
    Certain games like Mindscape's "Road Runner" game
    require those fields to be zero as part of it's
    Tandy detection routine.
  - PCjr mode will omit the reserved graphics RAM
    MCB block, and will subtract 16KB from the top
    at the BIOS level, if emulating 128KB system
    memory or less.
  - You can now run PCjr mode with as little as
    128KB of RAM. Removed 256KB minimum check from
    DOS kernel. Certain games (Mickey's Space
    Adventure) require memsizekb=128 and memsize=0
    in PCjr mode or else it will not work correctly
    due to how the game locates video system memory.
  - Fixed Tandy mode to place video memory at the
    top of conventional memory and allow running
    Tandy mode with a memsizekb setting as low as
    64KB, though 256KB or higher is recommended.
  - Added Tandy "real memory size" field in the
    BIOS data area.
  - Tandy emulation updated to subtract 16KB from
    top of conventional memory, which fixes some
    games and follows DOSBox SVN behavior and real
    hardware according to others on the Vogons forums.
  - Fixed bug that limited Tandy mode to 624KB of
    conventional memory. 32KB of video RAM is taken
    from top of memory, losing half of the 32KB
    breaks games that write to the system RAM instead
    of B800:0000 segment and causes half the graphics
    to not render.
  - CD-ROM image emulation now supports ISO images
    that are 2GB or larger, 32-bit integer size limit
    has been lifted.
  - Increased upper limit of "prebuffer" config option
    (in [mixer] section) from 100 to 250. It is still
    recommended to set a value less than 100. (Wengier)
  - Added scrollbar buttons to the Configuration Tool,
    so that the scrollbars better resemble the style of
    the Windows 3.1 scrollbars.
  - The help window for the Configuration Tool will now
    display possible and default values for the config
    options in addition to the descriptions. (Wengier)
  - Updated the MMX patch code by kekko. (Wengier)
  - MIXER command now supports the /GUI option to show
    a popup window to display the mixer information.
    Also improved its /LISTMIDI option which will show
    the name of the current MIDI handler and you can
    optionally specify a MIDI handler name (win32/alsa)
    to show the information for this handler. (Wengier)
  - Improved the compatibility of AUTOTYPE command with
    games like Asterix & Obelix. (Wengier)
  - The config options ttf.wpbg, ttf.bold, ttf.italic,
    ttf.underline, ttf.strikeout, and ttf.char512 can
    now be modified dynamically with CONFIG -SET ...
    commands, e.g. CONFIG -SET ttf.wpbg=2. (Wengier)
  - The minimal value for the ttf.ptsize config option
    has been decreased from 10 to 9. (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "Save logging as..." (under "Help"
    -> "Debugging options") to save the current logging
    content to the specified file. (Wengier)
  - Added slirp backend support for the NE2000 network
    feature (in addition to the existing pcap backend).
    There are config sections named [ethernet, slirp]
    and [ethernet, pcap] now to set the options for the
    slirp and pcap backends respectively. Please refer
    to the networking guide in the DOSBox-X Wiki for
    more information about the backends. (Jookia)
  - FAT driver can now support PC-98 HDI images with
    partitions that start at any physical sector even
    if the start is not a multiple of the ratio of
    logical to physical sector size. This allows the
    HDI image of Dragon Knight 4 to mount.
  - Control character 7 (BEEP) is now allowed while
    executing batch files without warnings. (Wengier)
  - With the setting "core=auto" DOSBox-X now updates
    the menu in the "CPU core" menu group automatically
    between "Normal core" and "Dynamic core" to reflect
    the CPU core which is currently in use. (Wengier)
  - Fixed Windows 95/98 installation failures caused by
    FAT driver and DOS API changes in previous version.
  - Fixed well-intended but erroneous fall through case
    in the INT15 handler that prevented 3rd party mouse
    drivers from detecting the PS/2 mouse.
  - Fixed the color issue with the Configuration Tool
    in the macOS SDL1 build. (ant_222)
  - Fixed switching ttf.cols, ttf.lins, and ttf.font
    options dynamically in full-screen mode. (Wengier)
  - Fixed menu options "Increase TTF font size" and
    "Decrease TTF font size" (both under "Video" =>
    "TTF options") not working (but keyboard shortcuts
    and those in the system menu work). (Wengier)
  - Fixed setting option "ttf.wp=xy3" or "ttf.wp=xy4"
    not working (but "ttf.wp=xy" did work). (Wengier)
  - Fixed preview function in WordStar not working for
    TrueType font output in previous version. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the issue that caused Windows 3.x group file
    corruption on hard disk image files. (SnikoLoft)
  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)
    - r4416: Added ability to start and stop avi
    recording, and to start keymapper, from config.
    - r4405: Smarter clearing of the dynrec cache.
0.83.11
  - Added support for the clipboard device (CLIP$) and
    DOS clipboard API on non-Windows systems (they were
    previously only supported on the Windows platform).
    In Linux SDL1 build only read access is supported
    whereas both read and write access are supported in
    all other builds. Also, selecting and copying text
    to the host clipboard using a mouse button or arrow
    key is now supported in macOS SDL1 build. (Wengier)
  - Added "Paste Clipboard" button to the AUTOEXEC.BAT,
    CONFIG.SYS and 4DOS.INI sections in Configuration
    Tool for pasting clipboard contents. (Wengier)
  - Windows SDL2 builds now use same clipboard pasting
    method as Windows SDL1 builds by default instead of
    the BIOS keyboard function. The method is now also
    available for Linux and macOS (both SDL1 and SDL2)
    builds (although it is disabled by default on these
    platforms). A menu option "Use BIOS function for
    keyboard pasting" is added to the "Shared clipboard
    functions" menu group (under "Main") to use BIOS
    function for the clipboard pasting instead of the
    keystroke method. Make sure this option is disabled
    if pasting clipboad text into Windows 3.x/9x apps
    (e.g. Notepad & Write) is desired. This setting can
    be changed with "clip_paste_bios" config option in
    in [sdl] section of the config file too. (Wengier)
  - With the config option "startcmd=true" or command-
    line option -winrun, Windows applications can now
    be launched from within a DOS program or from the
    4DOS shell in addition to built-in shell. (Wengier)
  - Added the "disable graphical splash" config option
    in [dosbox] section which when set will cause a
    text-mode BIOS splash screen to be always displayed
    at startup instead of the graphical one. If the
    TrueType font (TTF) output is enabled the text-
    mode BIOS screen is used automatically. (Wengier)
  - Added a simple BIOS Setup Utlity, which will show
    a summary of the current system configuration and
    allow users to change the date and time. Press Del
    key at the BIOS boot screen to enter. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "showbasic" in [sdl] section
    which when set to false will hide DOSBox-X version
    number and running speed in the titlebar. (Wengier)
  - Added experimental option to load a VGA BIOS ROM
    image and execute it, instead of our own INT 10h
    emulation. If enabled, it will load the specific
    ROM file into C000:0000. If not specified, it
    will choose based on machine type. VGA BIOS ROM
    images (e.g. et4000.bin for Tseng ET4000 emulation)
    can be dumped from real hardware or downloaded from
    the PCem ROMs collection. It can be set with config
    option "vga bios rom image" in [video] section.
  - Improved handling for file- and record-locking
    for non-Windows platforms. Portions of the code
    are adopted from DOSEmu. (Wengier)
  - Improved handling for the setting "ansi.sys=false",
    such as fixing the welcome screen messup in this
    case and allowing the use of a custom ANSI TSR
    (such as NNANSI.COM) instead. (Wengier & stu)
  - You can now press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break to break
    from long outputs from commands like TYPE, MORE,
    COPY, DIR /S, and ATTRIB /S. (Wengier)
  - Renamed MEM.COM to MEM.EXE to match DOS. (Wengier)
  - Rewrote built-in TREE command instead of the one
    from FreeDOS to support long filenames. (Wengier)
  - DELTREE is now an external command appearing on
    drive Z: as DELTREE.EXE instead of a builtin shell
    command, since it is an external command in a real
    DOS system. (Wengier)
  - Added REPLACE command to replace files, resembling
    the MS-DOS counterpart. This command is compiled
    with long filename support. (Wengier)
  - Added PUSHD and POPD commands so that you can store
    the current directory and changes to the specified
    directory (optionally also the current drive), then
    changes the directory/drive back. PUSHD command
    without arguments show stored path(s). (Wengier)
  - Added COLOR command to change current foreground
    and background colors. It usage is similar to the
    same-named command in the Windows command prompt.
    For example, command "COLOR fc" produces light red
    on bright white; COLOR without an argument restores
    the original color. (Wengier)
  - Added CHCP command to view the current code page,
    or change the current code page for the TrueType
    font (TTF) output. Supported code pages include:
    437, 808, 850, 852, 853, 855, 857, 858, 860, 861,
    862, 863, 864, 865, 866, 869, 872, and 874. You can
    now also set the code page for TTF output via the
    optional second parameter of the "country" option
    in [config] section of the configuration. (Wengier)
  - Added function to automatically save states in the
    specified time interval (in seconds). You can also
    specify a save slot or start and end save slots to
    be used. For example, "autosave=10 11-20" will set
    a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the
    save slots used will be between 11 and 20. If no
    save slot is specified, then the current save slot
    will be used for auto-saving. Putting a minus sign
    before time interval causes the auto-saving function
    to not be activated at start. You can optionally
    also specify up to 9 program names for this feature,
    e.g. "autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35" will
    cause program "EDIT" to use save slots 21-30, and
    "EDITOR" to use save slot 35, and other programs to
    use save slots 11-20. Added a menu option "Auto-save
    settings..." to manage the auto-saving feature at
    run-time. A menu option "Enable auto-saving state"
    is added to the "Save/load options" menu group under
    "Capture" to toggle auto-saving when the function is
    enabled. Likewise, a menu option "Select last auto-
    saved slot" is added to the "Select save slot" menu
    group (also under "Capture") to switch to the last
    auto-saved slot (if any). (Wengier)
  - The Configuration Tool windows are now scalable, so
    that they will no longer look very small in e.g.
    full-screen or High DPI modes. (ant_222)
  - If the -defaultdir option is the only or the last
    command-line option and no parameter is specified,
    then directory of the primary config file (if any)
    becomes the DOSBox-X default directory. (Wengier)
  - You can now change the current output dynamically
    with CONFIG command, e.g. "CONFIG -set output=ttf"
    and "CONFIG -set output=default". (Wengier)
  - The command "KEYB US" will return the DOS codepage
    to 437 if current codepage is different. (Wengier)
  - The setting "output=default" will enable the OpenGL
    output for Linux systems if possible. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the CGA/MCGA/MDA/Hercules-specfic shortcut
    function buttons in Mapper Editor, and the screen
    colors after exiting from Mapper Editor when using
    these machine types in Direct3D output (SDL1 build).
    Also fixed the messages in the welcome banner for
    these machine types to inform users the new default
    shortcuts (Ctrl(+Shift)+[F7/F8]). (Wengier)
  - Fixed DOS Int21/AH=0x5a "Create temporary file"
    function not generating unique files. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that the current drive goes back to Z drive
    when combined unmounts & mounts are used. (Wengier)
  - Fixed PC-98 keyboard handling of CTRL+A through
    CTRL+Z. CTRL+C now works correctly in PC-98 mode.
  - Fixed crash of Free Pascal compiler with dynamic
    core and setting "use dynamic core with paging on =
    auto" introduced in the previous version. (Wengier)
  - Fixed launching Windows programs when the working
    directory has no 8.3 filename entry. (Wengier)
  - Fixed issues with full-screen switch in some cases
    when the TrueType font output is enabled. (Wengier)
  - Fixed an issue in MinGW builds that no data will be
    sent to the OPL3Duo board. (DhrBaksteen)
  - Fixed screen flickering when hovering over the menu
    with Direct3D output in the Windows SDL2 build that
    was introduced in the last version. (Wengier)
  - Fixed mounting disk/CD images with long paths from
    the "Drive" menu may not work properly. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that the "Save" button in Configuration Tool
    did not save config file in last version. (Wengier)
  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)
    - r4346: Fix a long-standing crash that occurred
    when disconnecting a second joystick after
    partially mapping it.
    - r4344: Add F8 to toggle printable characters on
    and off in the debugger.
    - r4340: Fix behavior when main memory allocation
    fails.
    - r4336: Correct an oversight of r4186 when floppy
    disks are mounted.
    - r4330: some big endian improvements and drive_fat
    fixes. (jmarsh)
    - r4320: Report Q-Channel track number in BCD,
    meaning it is not converted to binary by the
    CD-ROM device driver. Fixes the CD-Player feature
    of DOS Navigator 1.51 when playing past track 15.
    - r4318: Add LOGC debug command to log cs:ip only.
0.83.10
  - The Windows key(s) in Windows and the Command key(s)
    in macOS will now be displayed as the "Windows" and
    "Command" keys instead of the "super" and the "meta"
    keys in SDL1 builds just like SDL2 builds. (Wengier)
  - Cursor blinking rate for TrueType font (TTF) output
    can now be customized with the ttf.blinkc option.
    Set an integer between 1 (fastest) and 7 (slowest)
    to change TTF cursor blinking rate, or setting it to
    0 for no cursor (or false for non-blinking cursor as
    in previous versions), with the default value being
    6 on PC-98 systems and 4 elsewhere. (Wengier)
  - Fixed parallel port emulation to allow MDA port 3BCh
    to work properly.
  - Enhanced the printer function on Windows platforms
    to allow printer names to be specified in [printer]
    section via the "device" option for direct printing
    to the selected device. If left empty, then Windows
    Print dialog will always be shown, or specifying "-"
    will cause it to show only once (unless the user
    clicks "Cancel"). Under "Help" menu there is now a
    menu option "List Printer Devices" to list printer
    devices on Windows, and the parallel port LPT1 now
    defaults to the printer on all platforms. (Wengier)
  - The dynamic_x86 CPU core can now handle page faults
    non-recursively, so you can now run the dynamic_x86
    core with Windows 9x/ME without crashes, although
    this may slightly decrease the performance, and it
    may be disabled by setting the config option "use
    dynamic core with paging on" in [cpu] section to
    "false"; the default value of this option has been
    changed to "auto" which will enable/disable itself
    based on whether the 386 paging and a guest system
    has been enabled. Also fixed incorrect behavior for
    handling trap flags in the dynamic core and updated
    the MMX code for improved performance. (koolkdev)
  - Added support for Direct3D output on Windows SDL2
    builds just like Windows SDL1 builds to become the
    default output in all Windows builds. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X now natively supports the pixel-perfect
    scaling! Set the option "output=openglpp" in [sdl]
    section of the config file to enable this output.
    Alternatively, the output can be selected from the
    menu ("Video" => "Output" => "OpenGL perfect") at
    run-time. It is recommended to set config options
    and "aspect=true" (whenever the emulated display
    has an aspect ratio of 4:3) and "doublescan=false"
    for openglpp output. Also, with high DPI displays
    (e.g. on Windows 7+ with DPI scaling enabled) it
    works better with full-screen mode and the setting
    "dpi aware=true". It was implemented by ant_222
    (patch author) with some code cleanups by Wengier.
  - Updated the Windows installer to add a page for
    new users to select a video system output to use -
    the default output (Direct3D), OpenGL with pixel-
    perfect scaling (openglpp or "OpenGL perfect") for
    improved image quality, and the TrueType font (TTF)
    output for text-mode DOS applications. (Wengier)
  - You can now supply a ZIP/7Z file as a parameter to
    DOSBox-X directly so that it will be mounted as C:
    drive when DOSBox-X starts. (Wengier)
  - Added overlay support for mounting PhysFS drives
    so that you can specify a write location when you
    mounted a ZIP/7Z archive by adopting an old patch.
    For example, command "MOUNT C C:\DIR -T OVERLAY"
    will specify path C:\DIR(\C_DRIVE) as the write
    location after mounting C: drive as a PhysFS drive
    with a command like "MOUNT FILES.ZIP". (Wengier)
  - Added ability to resolve file paths that include
    environment variables on Windows or tildes (~) on
    other platforms for various options in the config
    file, such as language and mapper file paths, MT32
    ROM & FluidSynth soundfont paths, [config] section
    options as well as file outputs for the printing
    and serial/parallel port functions. (Wengier)
  - Added calculator for DOS (EVAL.EXE), which appears
    on Z drive and can calculate both simple (such as
    sin(0) and cos(0)) and many advanced mathematical
    expressions in either command-line mode and or the
    interactive mode. (Wengier)
  - Added support for standard (VGA/EGA/CGA) and mono
    mode dual-screen setup by porting the patch. You
    can now start DOSBox-X with the option -display2
    followed by a color (white, green, amber) to enable
    this feature on debug builds. (Wengier)
  - You can now translate texts in DOSBox-X's drop-down
    menus. The message files as written by the config
    tool (CLI or GUI) will contain the menu texts for
    translations from the English language. (Wengier)
  - Added "file access tries" config option (in [dos]
    section) so that if a positive integer is provided
    (e.g. 1 or 3) DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock
    files on mounted local drives for the specified
    number of times before failing on Windows builds.
    It is especially useful for networked DOS database
    applications that require record locking. (Wengier)
  - Added "bannercolortheme" config option (in [dosbox]
    section) so that users can change the background
    color theme of the welcome banner from the default
    blue color when DOSBox-X starts. (Wengier)
  - Added "pcaptimeout" config option (in the [ne2000]
    section) to specify a read timeout value for pcap
    in milliseconds, or default value (-1 on Windows
    or 3000 otherwise) will be used. (Wengier & Jookia)
  - Added "Save & Restart" button to the Configuration
    Tool's "Save" option for saving the config file and
    then automatically restarting DOSBox-X with this
    saved configuration. Command-line options -wcboot,
    -wcdboot and -wcpboot are added to CONFIG command
    which resemble -wc, -wcd, and -wcp options but will
    reboot DOSBox-X after writing configfile. Command-
    line option -bc (-bootconf) is also added to reboot
    with specified config file (or the primary loaded
    config file if not specified) directly. (Wengier)
  - The config option ttf.font will now search for TTF
    fonts in the directory as specified by the fontpath
    option in [printer] section too. (Wengier)
  - Added special properties to CONFIG command such as
    "screenwidth", "screenheight", "windowwidth", and
    "windowheight" so that commands like "CONFIG -GET
    screenwidth" and "CONFIG -GET screenheight" will
    get the current screen width and height. (Wengier)
  - BOOT command without a parameter will now try to
    boot the current drive if possible. (Wengier)
  - You can now change properties such as "fullscreen",
    "glshader" and "windowposition" dynamically with
    CONFIG command. For example, command "config -set
    fullscreen=true" and "config -set windowposition="
    will now switch on the full-screen mode and center
    the window position respectively. For TrueType font
    output, you can now also change the TTF font, the
    number of rows and columns on the TTF screen, and
    the word processor for TTF dynamically using CONFIG
    command, e.g. "config -set ttf.font=test", "config
    -set ttf.lins=30", "config -set ttf.cols=100" and
    "config -set ttf.wp=wp". The limits for the options
    ttf.cols and ttf.lins are increased too. (Wengier)
  - Implemented the DOS network redirector functions so
    that the host name can be reported to DOS programs,
    unless the secure mode is enabled. You may need to
    set either the option ipx=true in [ipx] section or
    the option ne2000=true in [ne2000] section. Also
    added config option "network redirector" to [dos]
    section which if set to false disables the network
    redirector even with IPX/NE2000 enabled. (Wengier)
  - Fixed an issue that the DOSBox-X window size may be
    incorrect when restoring from a maximized window in
    the SDL2 builds. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that the menu option "Select OpenGL (GLSL)
    shader.." not working properly sometimes. (Wengier)
  - Fixed Ctrl+C not working in GNU ed. (Wengier)
  - Fixed large ISO images (>2GB) unable to be mounted
    using IMGMOUNT command. (Wengier)
  - Fixed build failure on Gentoo Linux. (fonic)
  - 3dfx games can now work with the Glide passthrough
    feature when a guest system (guest DOS or Windows
    9x) is currently running. The default setting for
    config option "keep private area on boot" in [dos]
    section is changed from "false" to "auto". (Wengier)
  - Improved the speed of the Voodoo hardware emulation
    for running games like Tomb Raider 3dfx. (Wengier)
  - Improved OPL3Duo support, such as adding a buffer
    thread to get rid of slowdowns & breakups in audio
    playback when using the board. (DhrBaksteen)
  - Updated the Tiny File Dialog library to the latest
    version v3.8.5, which fixes issues such as the
    compatibility problem with Windows XP. (Wengier)
  - Updated FLAC, MP3, and WAV CD-DA decoder libraries
    to the latest versions (0.12.28, 0.6.26 and 0.12.18
    respectively; per David Reid). (Wengier)
  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich & Wengier)
    - r4426: Emulate debug register 6 during trap flag
    emulation (and normal int 1). Fixes 544 (jmarsh)
    - r4401: Improve xchg to handle unwritable memory
    better for core_dyn_x86.
    - r4399: Finish up and add LOOP_NE and LOOP_E for
    core_dyn_x86.
    - r4393: Remove video page check when drawing
    internal mouse pointer, as the BIOS current page
    is not updated in some cases. Fixes QQP games: Lost
    Admiral, Conquered Kingdoms, and Solitaire's
    Journey. Also be a bit smarter about enabling
    autolock, supporting more cases where the mouse
    is used for input without resetting it.
    - r4392: Improve capturing of Zeliard and fix a
    few percussion-related capturing problems as well.
    - r4310: Improve PMAKE on big endian machines and
    fix some bugs. Fixes bug in 16 -> 15 bit color
    conversion.
    - r4309: Copy working directory when mounting an
    overlay.
    - r4307: Refinement of SoundBlaster checks, so no
    IRQ is raised when not in autodma mode.

0.83.9
  - Physical CD drives are now mountable in SDL2 builds
    just like SDL1 builds, so commands like "MOUNT -CD"
    should work in both SDL1 and SDL2 builds. Some code
    is adopted from the SDL2_CDROM library. (Wengier)
  - Implemented file locking support for mounting disk
    image files so that you cannot mount the same disk
    image files in read/write mode at the same time as
    this can cause possible disk corruptions. A config
    option "locking disk image mount" is added to the
    [dosbox] section which when set to false (or if the
    user mounts the image files read-only) will bypass
    the locking of image files. Also improved the DOS
    file locking function, which can be disabled by
    setting "share=false" in [dos] section. (Wengier)
  - Implemented PhysFS support so that you can mount
    archives (e.g. ZIP/7Z) as drives in read-only mode,
    e.g. "MOUNT C TEST.ZIP" or "MOUNT D FILES.7Z". Some
    code is ported from a custom DOSBox fork. The menu
    option "Mount an archive file (ZIP/7Z)" is added to
    Drive menu to mount archives as Drives. (Wengier)
  - INT 13h now obeys the "hard drive data rate limit"
    setting, using the same disk I/O delay code as
    INT 21h file I/O. [Issue #2039]
  - Linux/X11 SDL1 builds: Combine window move/resize
    into one call if possible, and not during window
    manager hints, to avoid resize problems with the
    XFCE 4.14 platform.
  - Added menu option "Create blank disk images..."
    (under "DOS" menu) to create blank floppy or hard
    disk images of a common disk size, including 360KB,
    400KB, 720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB and 2.88MB for floppy
    disk images and 250MB, 520MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB and 8GB
    for hard disk images. The 1GB option (-t hd_1gig)
    is also added to IMGMAKE command. (Wengier)
  - The Configuration Tool will now be centered within
    the DOSBox-X window for a better looking. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "synchronize time" in [dosbox]
    section which when set to true will allow DOSBox-X
    to automatically synchronize the date and time with
    the host system, unless you manually change date
    and/or time. A menu option "Synchronize host date/
    time" is added to the DOS menu. The function uses
    IRQ0 handler; it will not work in PC-98 mode nor if
    the timer isn't running at the standard 18.2Hz tick
    rate, as any other rate does not make sense and
    will cause only jitter and error. Also fixed two
    Demoscene entries sl_fokus and sl_haloo which use
    BIOS_TIMER with a faster hardware tick rate.
  - Added config option "showdetails" which when set to
    true enables the menu option "Show FPS and RT speed
    in title bar" at start. It is equivalent to -showrt
    and -showcycles command-line options. (Wengier)
  - Improved compatibility with Watcom C++ 2.0 when
    long filename (LFN) support is enabled. (Wengier)
  - Added support for starting DOSBox-X in a specific
    display on a multi-screen setup (Windows builds as
    well as Linux/macOS SDL2 builds). A config option
    "display" is added to the [sdl] section that users
    can specify a display for the DOSBox-X window to
    start. The option can be combined with the existing
    "windowposition" config option to specify the
    position on the specified display/screen. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now pop up a message box to inform
    the user when a Direct3D pixel shader is loaded
    from the menu on the Windows platform. (Wengier)
  - Extended serial (COM) ports from COM1-COM3 to COM1-
    COM9 in the [serial] section. The config options
    serial4-9 are advanced options. You can optionally
    specify base addresses for any serial ports. When
    the "file" option is used, you can additionally
    specify a program to open the file with "openwith"
    option. If the specified program cannot be executed
    due to some problem, DOSBox-X will try to start a
    program as specified with the "openerror" action,
    or it will show an error. For both serial (COM) and
    parallel (LPT) ports options, the program commands
    can be quoted with double quotes, or with single
    quotes if the "squote" option is added. (Wengier)
  - Extended parallel (LPT) ports from LPT1-LPT3 to
    LPT1-LPT9 in the [parallel] section. Config options
    lpt4-9 are advanced config options. You can also
    optionally specify base addresses and IRQs for
    these ports. The parallel1-9 config options are
    enhanced to allow the generated files to be started
    with the specified action: "openpcl" to start a
    program to open the file if the print output is
    detected to be PCL; "openps" to start a program if
    the print output is detected to be PostScript (PS);
    "openwith" to start a program otherwise. If you'd
    like to specify parameters then be sure to properly
    quote the string(s). Furthermore, if any of the
    specified program(s) cannot be executed, DOSBox-X
    will try to start a program as specified with the
    "openerror" action, or show an error. (Wengier)
  - Added "openwith" and "openerror" config options to
    [printer] section to start the specified program to
    open the printer output file. The [printer] section
    also accepts "fontdir" option where you can change
    the path ("FONTS" by default) where the printer TTF
    fonts (including courier.ttf, ocra.ttf, roman.ttf,
    sansserif.ttf, script.ttf) are located. If no TTF
    font can be found (either from the custom path or
    system path) for printing, the internal TTF font
    for the TTF output will be used. (Wengier)
  - Added read-only options to the Drive menu to mount
    host folders/drives or image files to the specified
    drive letter in read-only mode. (Wengier)
  - You can now use a single mapper file for both SDL1
    and SDL2 versions of DOSBox-X! The new mapper file
    will be divided to sections [SDL1] and [SDL2] for
    both versions. The mapper file can be specified
    with the mapperfile config option, or you can set
    the mapperfile_sdl1 and mapperfile_sdl2 config
    options to override mapperfile option. (Wengier)
  - Added -defaultmapper command-line option which will
    use default key bindings for the mapper. (Wengier)
  - The menu functions "Load mapper file", "Quick edit
    mode", "Stop clipboard pasting" and "Display state
    information" have been added to the key mapper so
    that you can now define your own shortcut keys to
    activate these functions. (Wengier)
  - The default shortcuts for the "Copy to clipboard",
    "Paste from clipboard", and the "Reset window size"
    functions are now Ctrl+F5, Ctrl+F6 and Host(F11/F12)
    +BackSpace respectively. (Wengier)
  - Added ttf.fontbold, ttf.fontital, and ttf.fontboit
    config options so that you can specify actual bold
    italic, and bold-italic TrueType fonts for use with
    the TTF output that will render the bold, italic,
    and bold-italic text styles using the actual TTF
    fonts (e.g. consolab, consolai, consolaz instead of
    consola) instead of making the original TTF font
    bold, italic, bold-italic automatically. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X now supports the use of arrow keys (left,
    right, up, down, home, end) to select and copy text
    to the host clipboard in addition to a mouse button
    (subject to the specified key modifier, or use the
    QuickEdit function). The arrow keys will move the
    selections; press Home key to start the actual text
    selection and End key to end text selection and to
    copy to the clipboard; press ESC key to cancel text
    selection. Set config option "clip_mouse_button" to
    "arrows" to enable it, or select it from "Shared
    clipboard functions" menu group. (Wengier)
  - You can now press the key combination Ctrl+Tab in
    the shell to see a list of files/directories that
    can be completed by the Tab completion. (Wengier)
  - Added SETCOLOR command to view or change the text-
    mode color scheme settings. Also fixed the color
    palette for the TTF output. (Wengier)
  - Separated "TTF options" menu group that contains
    TrueType font (TTF) related menu options from the
    "Text-mode" menu group in "Video" menu. (Wengier)
  - The "Show menu bar" option now appears in system
    menu of the Windows SDL2 build too. (Wengier)
  - If a language file fails to load, DOSBox-X will now
    show a warning dialog instead of exiting. (Wengier)
  - The option "clip_key_modifier" now accepts values
    like "ctrlalt", "ctrlshift", "altshift". (Wengier)
  - Fixed 2D texture not showing for 3dfx games in the
    Glide passthrough mode. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the mouse sensitivity menu option (under the
    "DOS" menu) not working. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the color palette problem when switching to
    graphic mode from mono mode. (Wengier)
  - Fixed full-screen TTF output may not fully cover
    the background screen in Linux. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that lines starting with "%" in [autoexec]
    section are being ignored. (Wengier)
  - Fixed issues with building the code with original
    MinGW using the ./build-mingw script. (Wengier)
  - Fixed option "output=ttf" not working properly with
    -startui/startmapper command-line option. (Wengier)
  - When the mouse is captured, the title bar will show
    the shortcut to release the mouse. (Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT now assumes the ISO type for .GOG/.INS
    files (which are equivalent to .CUE/.INS files)
    if no type is specified by the user. (Wengier)
  - Improved the dynamic core including the way its
    cache is allocated and to support dual mapping.
  - The FREECG98.BMP file (for PC-98 mode) is now
    rendered based on a unifont_jp TTF font instead
    of UnifontFullMediumMono.ttf. (roytam1)
  - Added support for automatic switching from TTF
    output to another output in PC-98 mode, allowing
    Windows 3.1 to run in this mode. (Wengier)
  - Added OPL3Duo support, which passes OPL3 output
    to an OPL3Duo Arduino board with a specific
    configuration if desired. Set the config option
    "oplemu=opl3duoboard" to use it. (josephillips85)
0.83.8
  - Added support for scalable TrueType font (TTF)
    output for text-mode programs. Set "output=ttf"
    and optionally a monospaced TTF font (such as
    consola) with config option "ttf.font" to use it.
    Lines and columns can be specified with config
    options "ttf.lins" and "ttf.cols", and the cursor
    can be made blinking with the option "ttf.blinkc".
    The config options "ttf.ptsize" and "ttf.winperc"
    can be used to set the TTF font size and window
    percentage respectively. If you specify a TTF font
    size with "ttf.ptsize" then "ttf.winperc" will be
    ignored. You can also specify a word processor
    (WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite) for the
    on-screen text-style and 512-character font (WP)
    features. When using the TTF output DOSBox-X will
    temporarily switch to a different output when a
    graphical mode is requested (or when trying to take
    a screenshot); the TTF output will be auto-switched
    back later), which can be customized via config
    option "ttf.outputswitch" (which defaults to auto).
    Menu items in the "Text-mode" menu group (under
    "Video" menu) have been expanded to support TTF
    options such as increasing/decreasing the TTF font
    sizes and on-screen text style toggling (including
    bold, italics, underline and strikeout). You can
    also select a TTF font to use at run-time with the
    "Select TrueType font (TTF)" menu option. (Wengier)
  - Added the "Load mapper file..." menu option (under
    "Main") to select and load a DOSBox-X mapper file
    at run-time. Be sure to select a SDL1 mapper file
    for SDL1 builds, and similar for SDL2. (Wengier)
  - You can now select a host key from the menu (under
    "Main") including Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, Alt+Shift,
    or use the mapper-defined host key as in previous
    versions (which default to F11 on Windows and F12
    otherwise). A config option "hostkey" is added so
    that you can specify it from config file. (Wengier)
  - Pasting text from the clipboard on macOS SDL1 build
    is now supported like Linux SDL1 build. (Wengier)
  - Added support for ARM-based Apple M1 MacBook. The
    dynamic core now works on ARM-based macOS systems.
    SDL1 builds updated to use newer audio APIs on the
    macOS platform so that the audio works once again
    when compiled and run on macOS 11 (Big Sur). Prior
    to the change, ancient versions of the API dating
    back to the mid 2000s were used which no longer
    work on Big Sur.
  - DOSBox-X will now look for the config file (i.e.
    dosbox-x.conf/dosbox.conf) and the mapper file in
    the directory containing the DOSBox-X executable
    too if the config or mapper file cannot be found
    in the DOSBox-X working directory. (Wengier)
  - The system menu in Windows SDL1 builds is now also
    available for Windows SDL2 builds, and menu items
    "Reset font size", "Increase TTF font size" and
    "Decrease TTF font size" are added. (Wengier)
  - Enhanced the mapper editor interface to allow more
    keyboard shortcuts to be added, shown in multiple
    pages in the mapper, navigable with the "Previous
    Page" and "Next Page" buttons. The text in the
    grids are now longer and clearer too. The default
    shortcuts for a few items are changed to use the
    Host key style (e.g. Host+S and Host+L for saving
    and loading states respectively). (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "List network interfaces" under
    "Help" menu to list network interfaces in the host
    system for the NE2000 feature. (Wengier)
  - Added menu group "DOS commands" under "Help" menu
    to display the help content for the selected DOS
    shell command (DIR, CD, etc). (Wengier)
  - Configuration Tool now provides the option to save
    to the primary or user config files. (Wengier)
  - Certain config options (e.g. doublescan) that were
    marked as advanced options are now general config
    options and will appear in dosbox-x.reference.conf
    apart from dosbox-x.reference.full.conf. (Wengier)
  - Added config options "saveremark" (default: true)
    and "forceloadstate" (default: false) in [dosbox]
    section which can be used to control if DOSBox-X
    should ask users to enter remarks when saving a
    state or show warnings when loading a saved state
    if there is a mismatch found. (Wengier)
  - The config option "pixelshader" is moved from the
    section [gui] to [render] so that it will be in the
    same section as the option "glshader". (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "Select OpenGL (GLSL) shader..." to
    allow OpenGL shader switch from the menu, just like
    the function for Direct3D pixel shaders. (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "Show IDE disk or CD status" under
    "DOS" menu to show the current assignments (disk or
    CD image) of the IDE controllers. (Wengier)
  - Fixed IDE CD assignment may not be reset when soft
    reboots are activated from guest systems. (Wengier)
  - The program 80x43.COM is added into the ZIP package
    TEXTUTIL.ZIP on the Z drive. You can also change
    current text screen to the 80x43 mode from the menu
    group "Text-mode" under "Video" menu. (Wengier)
  - Enhanced MODE command so that you can change the
    number of columns and lines in the screen with the
    syntax "MODE CON COLS=c LINES=n" (c=80 or 132, and
    n=25, 43, 50, or 60). The command "MODE CON" will
    show the current number of columns and lines in the
    screen as in a real DOS system. (Wengier)
  - Added FLAGSAVE command for the save state feature
    to flag (mark) one or more files to be saved and
    loaded. Type "FLAGSAVE /?" for more information on
    this command. (PogoMan361 and Wengier)
  - Enhanced A20GATE command to show the current status
    of the A20 gate when no parameter is given, along
    with other small improvements. (Wengier)
  - INT 21h DOS=HMA emulation, to enable the A20 gate,
    and autoa20fix, to disable the A20 gate, now checks
    whether the CPU is running in virtual 8086 mode.
    If vm86 detected, the code will control the A20
    gate by calling the XMS interface instead of direct
    reading/writing via port 92h. This consideration
    is required for autoa20fix to cooperate with
    Microsoft Windows 3.1. Note that Windows 3.1 does
    not virtualize port 92h. If it did, this workaround
    would not be necessary.
  - Added -a option to LOADFIX command which will auto
    allocate enough memory to fill lowest 64KB memory
    instead of using exactly 64KB memory. (Wengier)
  - Added autofixwarning option (true by default) which
    allows user to silence the messages when DOSBox-X
    tries to auto-fix "Packed file is corrupt" error
    when running a program with this issue. (Wengier)
  - Added autoa20fix option (enabled by default). This
    option when enabled attempts to resolve EXEPACK
    "Packed file is corrupt" errors by temporarily
    disabling the A20 gate and running the program
    again. This may provide better support for affected
    DOS applications than the LOADFIX option. If both
    autoa20fix and autoloadfix are set, then autoa20fix
    will be tried first, and if it did not work then
    autoloadfix will be tried next.
  - The autoloadfix config option changed to allocate
    only enough memory to keep the executable above the
    64KB boundary, instead of blindly allocating 64KB.
  - Fixed menu items "Rescan drive" and "Swap disk" in
    "Drive" menu being reversed. (Wengier)
  - Fixed CD audio issue with the game "The Secret of
    Monkey Island" when talking to the pirate in Scumm
    Bar by adapting the patch that fixes it. Thanks
    kcgen for the fix logic. (Wengier)
  - Added support for MAME CHD CD images. You can now
    mount CHD images with IMGMOUNT command, or from the
    Drive menu. Based on libchdr library and the work
    of the user whocares010. (Wengier)
  - Updated FLAC/MP3/WAV CD-DA decoder libraries to the
    latest versions (versions 0.12.22, 0.6.19, 0.12.14
    respectively). Thanks to mackron & kcgen. (Wengier)
0.83.7
  - The primary DOSBox-X Wiki is now located at the
    URL: https://dosbox-x.com/wiki (Wengier)
  - Implemented the x86 dynamic core for both 32-bit
    and 64-bit systems by re-porting the code from SVN.
    Dynamic core now supports either the dynamic_x86
    or the dynamic_rec core. The dynamic_x86 core will
    be used by default for x86 and x86_64 platforms and
    if "core=dynamic" is set, and Windows 9x can be run
    in this dynamic core (although at this time may
    encounter some issue with the S3 driver). You can
    also explicit specify setting "core=dynamic_x86" or
    "core=dynamic_rec" for either the dynamic_x86 core
    or the dynamic_rec core. Also thank joncampbell123
    for the 64-bit fix. (Wengier)
  - You can now use your own save file (in addition to
    save slots! There are now a "Use save file" toggle
    item and "Browse save file..." for browsing save
    files on your computer. A config option "savefile"
    (in [dosbox] section) is added to specify a save
    file to use at start. (Wengier)
  - Save state feature now allows users to optionally
    enter remarks when saving a state. A submenu group
    "Save/load option" is added (under "Capture") where
    you can toggle menu items "No remark when saving
    state" (for disabling input of remarks when saving)
    and "force load state mode". A menu item "Display
    state information" is added as well to display the
    information of the saved state. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now use native dialog box to display
    quit warnings and save state errors. (Wengier)
  - Changed some DOS error messages (such as "Illegal
    command" which now reads "Bad command or filename")
    similar to real DOS systems. (Wengier)
  - ADDKEY and INT2FDBG commands now appear as programs
    on Z: drive instead of shell commands. (Wengier)
  - Improved the -z (move virtual drive Z:) function of
    MOUNT command. You can move the virtual drive as
    many times as you want, and save/load states will
    work even after you move the Z: drive. (Wengier)
  - Enhanced the config option "freesizecap" to allow
    the setting "fixed" which is the same as "false",
    and a new setting "relative" is added, which will
    be similar to the setting "fixed" but the reported
    free disk size will also change relative to the
    change of the free disk size ever since. (Wengier)
  - Added support for Opus CD-DA tracks by porting and
    cleaning up the source code from other projects.
    Many thanks to Marty Shepard and kcgen. (Wengier)
  - Support for FluidSynth MIDI Synthesizer is now
    included in the MinGW builds by default just like
    Visual Studio builds. Set "mididevice=fluidsynth"
    and a soundfont file to use it. (Wengier)
  - Enabled xBRZ scaler for Visual Studio SDL2 builds
    just like Visual Studio SDL1 builds. (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "Show Sound Blaster configuration"
    under "Sound" menu to show the current information
    about Sound Blaster, and also menu item "Show MIDI
    device configuration" (also under "Sound" menu)
    to show information about the current MIDI device
    such as the soundfont file in use. (Wengier)
  - Added "Mount multiple disk/CD images" option to the
    mounting options of the Drive menu to allow users
    to mount more than one disk/CD images to a drive,
    swappable from the menu. Also added separators to
    the Drive submenu to make it look better. (Wengier)
  - Added new CPU types to the "Emulate CPU speed" menu
    group namely 286-25MHz, 386DX-25MHz, 486DX4-100MHz,
    486DX5-133MHz, Pentium-60MHz, Pentium-75MHz, and
    Pentium-90MHz. Thanks again for the data provided
    by the user maximus105. (Wengier)
  - You can now select a special key (e.g. Alt+Tab,
    Ctrl+Break, Ctrl+Alt+Del, etc) to be sent from the
    key defined in the mapper editor. The key can be
    selected (Ctrl+Alt+Del by default) from the "Send
    special key" menu group in "Main" menu. (Wengier)
  - Added full Ctrl+Break emulation at the BIOS and
    DOS level, updated console emulation to match.
    The "Pause" mapper shortcut is now moved to
    HOST[F11/F12]+Pause instead of Ctrl+Pause so that
    Ctrl+Break can work properly for users, and the
    function to send the Ctrl+Break key from the menu
    ("Send special key" under "Main") is added. Also,
    the PC-98 STOP key now functions the same as the
    Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Break keys in IBM PC mode.
  - Added functions "CopyToClipboard" and "QuickRun" to
    the mapper editor so that you can use shortcuts to
    activate them (default shortcuts: HOST(F11/F12)+A
    and HOST(F11/F12)+Q respectively), and a default
    shortcut HOST(F11/F12)+V is added to the clipboard
    paste function. Meanwhile, FullCore and SimpleCore
    shortcuts are removed from the mapper. (Wengier)
  - Added two new menu items in the "Shared clipboard
    functions" menu group under "Main", including "Copy
    all text on the DOS screen" which will copy all
    screen text to the clipboard, and "Stop clipboard
    pasting" which allows user to stop pasting in the
    middle of pasting long clipboard content. (Wengier)
  - The mouse copy/paste feature is now available for
    non-Windows systems on SDL2 builds. Also, pasting
    from the clipboard with a mapped shortcut is also
    available for Linux/X11 on SDL1 builds. (Wengier)
  - Added "Use US keyboard layout" toggle menu item in
    the "PC-98" menu group under "Video" to select
    whether to force the default US keyboard layout in
    PC-98 mode, same as the "pc-98 force ibm keyboard
    layout" config option in [pc98] section. Also moved
    the "PC-98 PIT master clock" options from the "DOS"
    menu to this menu group. (Wengier)
  - The full dosbox-x.reference.conf file is renamed to
    dosbox-x.reference.full.conf. The original file
    dosbox-x.reference.conf now contains common config
    options instead of all config options. (Wengier)
  - The CONFIG command and Configuration Tool will now
    save common and modified config options by default.
    The -all command-line option (or "Save all options
    to the configuration file" checkbox) will force to
    save all config options. A new -mod command-line
    option is added to CONFIG command to save modified
    config options only, and a new -norem command-line
    option is added to not write remarks. (Wengier)
  - Updated the Windows installer to default to the
    "typical" installation. For the full installation
    start menu items will be added for DOSBox-X builds
    copied to subdirectories. A new checkbox "Write
    common config options (instead of all) to the
    configuration file" is added which when checked
    will only write common and modified advanced config
    options to the config file. Furthermore, for both
    "typical" and "full" installations the Windows
    installer will now also copies the DLL files
    inpout32.dll (32-bit) and inpoutx64.dll (64-bit) to
    the DOSBox-X install directory for use with the
    direct parallel port passthrough feature. (Wengier)
  - Improved Flatpak support for Linux. (rderooy)
  - Improved message for the -help command-line option,
    adding for example -silent and -socket command-line
    options in the help messages. (Wengier)
  - Added -silent command-line option to run DOSBox-X
    silently (without showing the DOSBox-X window) and
    then exit after executing AUTOEXEC.BAT. (Wengier)
  - Fixed command-line option -socket not working for
    the null-modem feature. (Wengier)
  - Fixed issue that aspect ratio not being respected
    in full-screen mode when a GLSL shader is enabled
    with an OpenGL output. (Wengier)
  - Fixed toggle in the "Frameskip" menu group did not
    change when selecting a different option. (Wengier)
  - Fixed shelling from programs may not work when the
    shell config option is set. (Wengier)
  - The default country setting ("country" option in
    [config] section]) now defaults to auto-detection
    if possible, or 81 (Japan) in PC-98 mode. (Wengier)
  - Increased the default maximum DOS files (adjustable
    from [config] section) from 127 to 200. (Wengier)
  - Improved resetting with LOADLIN program. (Wengier)
  - Improved Gravis Ultrasound (GUS) implementation to
    make it more accurately represent the GUS DMA state
    as expected by the running DOS software.
  - The archive attribute will no longer automatically
    be applied to directories on non-Windows systems.
    This fixed issue with PLAYMIDI.EXE from Gravis
    Ultrasound when listing directories. (Wengier)
  - Applied hack to allow the low DMA channel detection
    in the SB16 DIAGNOSE program to work. (Wengier)
  - The default setting of the clip_paste_speed option
    has been changed from 20 to 30, which will help
    prevent lost keystrokes when pasting from the host
    clipboard for some programs. (Wengier)
  - With Pentium CPU setting (cputype=pentium) DOSBox-X
    no longer reports FDIV bug by default. An advanced
    config option "report fdiv bug" is added to report
    such CPU bug when set to true. (rderooy & Wengier)
  - Added support for the XDG_DATA_HOME environment
    variable for config directory in Linux. (rderooy)
  - Added support for compiling with pcap for Windows
    MinGW builds. (Jookia)
  - Added config option "windowposition" (in [sdl]
    section) to set the window position at startup in
    the positionX,positionY format. (tomba4)
  - Added config option "raw_mouse_input" (in [sdl]
    section; SDL2 builds only) to bypass the operating
    system's mouse acceleration & sensitivity settings.
    Implemented by NicknineTheEagle.
  - Added config option "startquiet" (in [dos] section)
    which when set to true will silence the information
    messages before launching Windows programs to run
    on the Windows host. A toggle menu item "Quiet mode
    (no start messages)" is added to the "Windows host
    applications" menu group in "DOS" menu. (Wengier)
  - The menu "Show details" (under "Main") is renamed
    to "Show FPS and RT speed in title bar". (Wengier)
  - Add menu group "Text-mode" under "Video" menu to
    change some text-mode related video settings, such
    as changing the number of rows and columns. A zip
    package named TEXTUTIL.ZIP is added to the Z drive
    that contains various utilities (such as CGA.COM,
    EGA.COM, 132X25.COM, 132X43.COM) to change current
    video setting from the command line. Also added a
    config option "high intensity blinking" which when
    set will display high intensity background colors
    instad of blinking foreground text. The menu item
    "Allow 9-pixel wide fonts" is moved from the menu
    group "Compatibility" to here. (Wengier)
  - Added "Debugging" menu group under "Help" menu, and
    moved items from the "Video" Debug and "DOS" Debug
    menus and the debugger here (debug builds only).
    Also allowed to hide/show the console or debugger
    window in Windows debug builds. With the menu item
    "Console wait on error" checked the Windows console
    window will wait for the ENTER key before closing
    itself after an E_EXIT occurs. (Wengier)
  - Updated MPXPLAY to latest version 1.65. (Wengier)
  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)
    - r4386: Correct MPU-401 clock-to-host function to
    operate independently of playing. Fixes hang at
    exit when playing Roland music in demos by The
    Phoney Coders. Clamp tempo to valid range.
    - r4384: ICW1 on the PIC clears the Interrupt Mask
    Register. Fixes Antagony and quite a few demos that
    expect IRQs to be unmasked.
    - r4382: Refine adlib timers a bit more and make
    reading the Adlib take a bit more time.
    - r4378: Prevent some possible deadlocks with sti
    in dynrec core.
    - r4375: Improve compatibility with older Intel
    chipsets
    - r4374: Add a bit of hack so cycles=max/auto 90%
    keeps on working inside batch files after r3925.
    - r4371: Fix regression in Clue: Master Detective.
    - r4370: As an adjunct to r4369, make the reference
      counts of standard device handles equivalent to
      those of real DOS.
    - r4369: Compatible side-effect behavior of DOS in
      the file close function.
    - r4368: Improve error codes for some DOS file functions.
    - r4367: Change FPU_FBST to only write 18 decimals
      instead of the wrongly 19, this makes it possible
      to switch 64 integers which in turn fixes some
      rounding issues. (jmarsh)
    - r4282,r4283: Switch to a different way to calculate
      DBOPL table offsets.
    - r4280: Prevent GenerateDMASound from running with
      input of 0.
    - r4279: Remove DMA_TRANSFEREND and replace with
      DMA_MASKED.
    - r4277: Remove cases not needed after r4276

    - r4261: These actually use float as input.
    - r4258: Rename bios tester to biostest and make it
      debug only to avoid people trying to load real
      bioses.
    - r4257: Add simple program that allows you to boot
      into a bios image for running cpu tester bios.
0.83.6
  - Improved internal Voodoo card hardware emulation,
    such as fixing the font issue with the 3dfx version
    of Tomb Raider when using non-Glide mode. Portions
    of the code are ported from DOSBox ECE. (Wengier)
  - Added OpenGL shader support by porting the feature
    from DOSBox SVN. GLSL shaders are now supported in
    both SDL1 and SDL2 builds, and this also allows
    pixel-perfect scaling to be enabled for the OpenGL
    outputs. The config option "glshader" (in [render]
    section) can be used to specify a GLSL shader file
    or a built-in shader when the output is set to
    "opengl" or "openglnb". For example, you can use
    the setting "glshader=sharp" (built-in shader) or
    "glshader=pixel_perfect" (with GLSL shader file)
    for the pixel-perfect scaling mode. The Windows
    installer will also copy several GLSL shader files
    to the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X
    install directory to be used directly. (Wengier)
  - Support for FluidSynth MIDI Synthesizer is now
    included in the Windows Visual Studio builds by
    default. Set "mididevice=fluidsynth" and a sound
    font (e.g. GeneralUser_GS.sf2) to use it. (Wengier)
  - Updated the MUNT MT32 emulation library to its
    latest version 2.4.0. A few new MT32 config options
    (starting with "mt32.") are added to [midi] section
    of the DOSBox-X configuration. (Wengier)
  - The DOSMID and MPXPLAY programs have been built
    into DOSBox-X, both can be found on the Z drive and
    feature full-screen user interfaces with support
    for command-line usages (use /? option for help).
    DOSMID can play MIDI/RMI/MUS audio files, whereas
    MPXPLAY is a powerful and flexible audio player
    with support for a variety of formats including
    AAC/AC3/APE/FLAC/MP2/MP3/MPC/OGG/WAV and more with
    playlist support. (Wengier)
  - The mounting options "Mount as Hard Disk", "Mount
    as CD-ROM", "Mount as Floppy", "Mount disk image"
    and "Boot from disk image" (previously only for
    Windows) in the "Drive" menu and the "Quick launch
    program..." in the "DOS" menu are now available
    for non-Windows platforms as well. (Wengier)
  - Added "Shared Windows clipboard functions" menu
    group under "Main", which allows you to enable
    or disable the different ways for DOSBox-X to
    communicate with the Windows clipboard. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "dos clipboard api" in [dos]
    section to control whether to enable the DOS APIs
    for communications with the Windows clipboard for
    DOS applications. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "clip_mouse_button" to select
    a mouse button (middle, right, or none; with right
    mouse button being the default) for copying to and
    pasting from the Windows clipboard. (Wengier)
  - The mouse wheel movements will be automatically
    converted into up/down arrows by default for the
    intergrated DOS now. You can also enable it for
    the guest system from the "Main" menu ("mouse wheel
    movements" -> "Enable for guest systems also") or
    from the config file. (Wengier)
  - Added "Emulate CPU speed" menu group (under "CPU")
    to emulate the speed of a specific CPU class. The
    cycles to emulate are approximations of the actual
    CPU hardware, and they are available thanks to data
    provided by the user maximus105. Also added config
    option "cycle emulation percentage adjust" in [cpu]
    section for users who would like to make relative
    percentage adjustments (between -25% and 25%) in
    case it is necessary. (Wengier)
  - Added SORT command from FreeDOS. It can be used to
    sort input, e.g. "TYPE FILE.TXT | SORT". (Wengier)
  - Added DELTREE command to delete a directory and all
    the subdirectories and files in it as in a real DOS
    system. Please use it with caution. (Wengier)
  - The command for starting the Configuration Tool has
    been renamed from "SHOWGUI" to "CFGTOOL". A new
    command-line option -gui is added to CONFIG command
    to start the Configuration Tool as well. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X now includes ZIP.EXE and UNZIP.EXE from
    InfoZip for zipping and unzipping files in DOS.
    Both programs will appear on the Z drive. (Wengier)
  - The powerful DOS CD player called SJGPLAY has been
    built into DOSBox-X. You can now find the program
    CDPLAY.EXE in the Z drive for playing Audio CDs in
    DOS, which supports both graphical and command-line
    usage, and you will also find a text file named
    CDPLAY.TXT in the Z drive for a quick usage guide.
    A zip package including full documentation and some
    extras will additionally appear as SJGPLAY.ZIP in
    the Z drive. This freeware program was written by
    Steve Gray and is now included in DOSBox-X with
    explicit permission of the author. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now by default show a quit warning
    if a DOS program or game, or a guest system is
    running. The previous behavior can be set with
    "quit warning=autofile". (Wengier)
  - The welcome banner when DOSBox-X starts has been
    improved for a better looking and should provide
    more helpful instructions for users. (Wengier)
  - Add new "Help" menu which includes menu items
    "Introduction", "DOSBox-X homepage", "DOSBox-X Wiki
    guide", "DOSBox-X support" and "About". (Wengier)
  - Improved the message when automatically re-running
    the executable which failed with the "Packed file
    is corrupt" error. Also added the "autoloadfix"
    config option which when set to "false" will not
    automatically re-run such programs. (Wengier)
  - The display for several section names in DOSBox-X's
    graphical configuration tool has been capitalized
    or modified otherwise to look better. A default
    shortcut key HOST(F11/F12)+C is added for starting
    the graphical configuration tool. (Wengier)
  - Added the "Show advanced options" checkbox in the
    main screen of the Configuration GUI to toggle
    whether to display all config options for the
    sections. If unchecked (default), it will show
    common config options instead of all of them. A
    new config option "show advanced options" is added
    which when set to "true" will make the checkbox
    checked by default. (Wengier)
  - Added code to cap the scan line length given to
    the VESA BIOS given the video mode. This prevents
    VBETEST.EXE from doing test patterns smaller than
    the actual display, which can happen with 32bpp
    320x200 modes and 1MB or less video RAM.
  - VESA BIOS Set Scan Line Length fixed to properly
    report and handle scan line length for 16-color
    SVGA planar modes. VBETEST 16-color modes now
    display correctly.
  - Added option to control whether VESA BIOS panning
    (the original VBE call) waits for vsync.
  - Moved video related config options from [dosbox]
    section to its own [video] section. These options
    in existing config files will be automatically
    redirected to the [video] section from the [dosbox]
    section when DOSBox-X starts. Windows installer can
    also move such config options from existing config
    files automatically. (Wengier)
  - Cleared modem phone book before parsing it. Thank
    NicknineTheEagle for the improvement.
  - Improved the help message of MOUNT command. Also
    added option -examples to show its usage examples,
    similar to IMGMOUNT and IMGMAKE commands. (Wengier)
  - Fixed freeze when trying to reboot the internal
    DOS when using a different code page and it is in
    CGA or EGA emulation modes. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now try to use the internal DOS date
    and time (instead of always using the host date and
    date) for file modication timestamps. (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "Expanded memory (EMS)" under "DOS"
    menu to dynamically enable or disable EMS memory
    at run-time. You can now also modify EMS memory
    with CONFIG command from command-line. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "drive z hide files" (in [dos]
    section) to hide or remove files listed (separated
    by spaces) from the Z drive. If a file has a "/"
    prefix (e.g. "/INTRO.COM"), then the specified file
    will have the hidden attribute ("DIR /A" will list
    all such files) instead of completely disappearing
    from the Z drive. (Wengier)
  - You can now add your own programs or files to the
    Z drive! Put your programs or files in the drivez
    directory located in the DOSBox-X program folder
    or the DOSBox-X configuration directory, and they
    will automatically appear on the Z drive. If any of
    the files have the same names as the built-in ones,
    they will replace the built-in files. For example,
    you can replace the built-in EDIT.COM and XCOPY.EXE
    programs (from FreeDOS) with MS-DOS counterparts.
    Windows installer will now automatically create a
    drivez directory with a README.TXT file in it too.
    For subdirectories support please use MOUNT command
    to mount local directory instead. (Wengier).
0.83.5
  - Windows installer now offers the option to upgrade
    the DOSBox-X config file (dosbox-x.conf) to the
    latest version format automatically while keeping
    users' current settings. It can also add a context
    menu for executables (.exe, .com, .bat), config
    files (.conf) and folders in the Windows Explorer
    so that you could quickly run or open them with
    DOSBox-X from the Windows Explorer. More icons
    are added to the DOSBox-X program group within the
    Start menu as well. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "startbanner" in [dosbox]
    section which if set to "false" would skip the
    welcome banner when DOSBox-X starts. Also added
    config option "fastbioslogo" which if set to "true"
    will skip the BIOS logo (replacing the command-line
    option -fastbootlogo). A new command-line option
    "-fastlaunch" is added to enable fast launch mode
    by skipping both the logo and the banner. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "ega per scanline hpel" in
    [dosbox] section to control whether EGA emulation
    latches hpel at display start (as VGA emulation
    does) or allows hpel to change per scanline.
    Setting the option to false is needed for some
    games like Commander Keen.
  - Support for mounting CD images with a sector size
    of 2448, used by for example the MDF image of the
    game Grand Theft Auto. (Wengier)
  - Allowed Sound Blaster to be enabled by the games
    "Desert Strike" and "Jungle Strike". (Wengier)
  - Sound Blaster Pro emulation now maps DSP commands
    0x41 to 0x47 as aliases of 0x40 (set time constant)
    to support broken demoscene code that uses 0x41
    in that way. Yes, such code would obviously break
    on clone cards and the SB16. Added a config option
    "dsp command aliases" in [sblaster] section to turn
    it off for debugging. Alias is documented on Vogons
    forums where someone made a SB Pro clone card.
  - Fixed the issue with CD audio play by porting the
    audio code from DOSBox ECE. (Wengier)
  - COPY command now assumes /Y automatically when
    running in the batch file or with CALL command
    (or COMMAND /C) as in real DOS. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will allow control characters 8 (BS),
    9 (TAB), 26 (SUB), and 27 (ESC) when executing GOTO
    command in batch files without warnings. (Wengier)
  - Normal core: REP MOVSD now checks segment limits
    for ES:(E)DI and throws a GP fault if exceeded.
    Demoscene productions marked as using VESA BIOS
    modes and scribbling on the VGA BIOS are relying
    on segment limits and GP faults to fake a linear
    framebuffer.
  - Added config option "vesa bank switching window
    range check" to allow disabling the VESA BIOS
    window number range check when called on to
    bank switch. Needed for "Pill" by Opiate in the
    end credits, which for some reason requires a
    call for window number 0xFFFF to succeed in order
    to draw credits without glitching.
  - Added config option "vesa bank switching window
    mirroring" for instructing VESA BIOS to ignore
    bank switching window parameter when asked to
    get/set bank switching window setting. Needed for
    some old demoscene and game applications that
    assume Window B is available, and will not render
    SVGA properly without it.
  - Added config option "quit warning" to indicate if
    DOSBox-X should warn show a warning message when
    you try to close the DOSBox-X window. If set to
    "auto" (default), DOSBox-X will warn only if at
    least one file handle is still open, or you are
    currently running a guest system. (Wengier)
  - Added command-line option "-defaultconf" to use the
    default config settings. (Wengier)
  - Added command-line option "-defaultdir" to specify
    a directory (instead of the current directory) as
    the working directory. DOSBox-X will look for the
    dosbox-x.conf file in this directory. (Wengier)
  - The -winrun command-line option will also enable
    LFN support with "lfn=auto" on Windows. (Wengier)
  - VER /R now shows DOSBox-X's Git commit SHA1, in
    addition to the build date and other version
    information shown by the VER command. (Wengier)
  - Fixed that joystick may not work with the setting
    "usescancodes=auto" when a non-US keyboard layout
    is activated on the SDL1 build. (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will now search for system fonts if the
    fonts required for the printing feature cannot be
    found in the FONTS directory. (Wengier)
  - Added menu item "Send form-feed" under the DOS menu
    for manually ejecting new pages to print. (Wengier)
  - Added "Quick launch program..." menu (under "DOS")
    to quickly run the specified program as selected
    by the Windows file browser in DOSBox-X. (Wengier)
  - Added "Drive information" menu item under "Drive"
    menu to show information for the specified drive,
    and added "Show mounted drive numbers" menu item
    under "DOS" menu to show details for all mounted
    drive numbers (0-5). (Wengier)
  - The command "Swap CD" now swaps only CD drives (as
    the name), not all non-floppy drives. Also added
    "Swap disk" menu item under the "Drive" menu for
    swapping individual mounted drives. (Wengier)
  - IMGMAKE now tries to resolve home directory (~)
    on Linux and macOS platforms. Also improved the
    help message for this command. (Wengier)
  - Fixed unmounting swap disks when unmounting drives
    with MOUNT or IMGMOUNT command. (Wengier)
  - Fixed possible failure when mounting .VHD images,
    and the issue that leading colon (:) or read-only
    marker may not work for such images. (Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT command without parameters now shows the
    disk position and number of swap disks, as well as
    IDE controller (if applicable). Also added option
    -examples to show its usage examples. (Wengier)
  - Add "-ro" option for IMGMOUNT command to mark all
    disk images as read-only at once. You could also
    mark read-only disk images individually using the
    leading colon as in previous versions. (Wengier)
  - The default value for "output" (in "sdl" section)
    is now "default", which will default to the value
    according to your platform. (Wengier)
  - The -Q (quiet) option of MOUNT, BOOT and RESCAN
    commands now silences virtually all outputs (error
    and normal messages) of these commands. (Wengier)
  - Worked around the mounting issue with LaunchBox,
    by allowing a mounting command-line with single
    quotes like MOUNT C 'X:\DOS' on Windows. (Wengier)
  - Unmounting ISO drives will auto-unmount associated
    El Torito floppy drives (if any) too. (Wengier)
  - Updated xxHash library by Yann Collet from 0.7.4
    to the stable version 0.8.0. (Wengier)
  - Added support for the OPL2 audio board by setting
    the config option "oplemu=opl2board".
  - The save state feature now tries to save and then
    restore the mounted drives of all types (if the
    paths or image files still exist on host system).
    This fixes the "save state corrupted" error while
    trying to load saved states but the drives are not
    yet mounted in DOSBox-X. (Wengier)
  - The save state feature now verifies the emulated
    machine type (VGA, PC98, etc) too when loading a
    saved state. All confirm and error dialog boxes
    for saving or loading states appear in a cross-
    platform manner now, instead of only on Windows
    systems. Also added the option to remove the saved
    state in the selected save slot. (Wengier)
  - Increased the number of save slots from 10 to 100.
    Each page in the save slot menu (under "Capture")
    still shows 10 slots as before, but you can now go
    to the previous or next page (up to 10 pages) for
    more save slots (100 in total). (Wengier).
  - The [pci] section is now the [voodoo] section, and
    the config option "voodoo" (the only option of that
    section) is now named "voodoo_card" within the
    [voodoo] section to make clear it is for emulating
    the Voodoo card hardware. Also added config option
    "voodoo_maxmem" (default: true) to specify whether
    to use the maximum memory size (12MB instead of the
    standard 4MB) for the Vooodoo card. (Wengier)
  - Added support for Glide wrapper. It can be enabled
    with the new config option "glide" set to "true"
    in [voodoo] section. The library file glide2x.dll
    (Windows)/libglide2x.so (Linux)/libglide2x.dylib
    (macOS) is required for Glide to work. Be sure to
    use 32-bit dll for 32-bit DOSBox-X binary, and
    64-bit dll for 64-bit DOSBox-X binary. (Wengier)
0.83.4
  - Fixed loading saved states in fullscreen mode with
    the "aspect=true" setting. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "saveslot" to select default
    save slot (1-10). The timestamps for the saved
    states will also be shown in the menu. (Wengier)
  - Added key mapper for sending the Ctrl+Alt+Del key,
    with HOST(F11/F12)+Del by default. (Wengier)
  - Added dosbox-x.conf setting to ignore the EGA/VGA
    "extended memory" bit. It was originally defined
    back when stock EGA/VGA cards could ship with 64KB
    of memory. The option is needed for DOS games that
    accidentally clear the bit when using unchained
    256-color modes (Mr. Blobby).
  - Added new default value "auto" for the setting
    "usescancodesauto" (in [sdl] section of the config
    file) to work around issues with non-US keyboard
    layouts on SDL1 builds. (Wengier)
  - Added code pages 808, 850, 852, 853, 855, 857,
    858, 869, 872 for host to guest codepage mapping
    on mounted local or overlay drives. (Wengier)
  - The mapper options "Increase recording volume" and
    "Decrease recording volume" as well as function
    "Show sound levels" (from MIXER command) appear
    now as menu items (under "Sound") too. (Wengier)
  - Fixed inputting of ASCII character 224 and 240
    in Windows SDL2 or MinGW builds. (Wengier)
  - Fixed possible DPMI error when running Windows
    98 installation from the DOSBox-X shell without
    using a batch file. (Wengier)
  - Fixed a bug in the FAT driver that can cause
    a byte to get lost if writing up to the end of
    a cluster, which seems to be behind the
    corruption with program group files when running
    Windows for Workgroups 3.11 from DOSBox-X shell.
    [https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues/1758#issuecomment-665193066]
  - Unknown INT 2Fh calls are now debug output, not
    an error.
  - Added VESA BIOS mode 68h alias as indicated on
    the Vogons forum.
  - Fixed handling of config commands with spaces
    when the "shell configuration as commands"
    setting is enabled (quotes are needed in such
    cases). Also added "Config options as commands"
    toggle menu (under "DOS") to enable/disable the
    feature from menu. It is disabled by default to
    avoid name clash with other programs. (Wengier)
  - Added "Enable quick reboot" toggle menu (under
    "DOS") so that when enabled, DOS restart calls
    will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated or
    guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine in
    DOSBox-X. Also, you could change the default
    setting for this by setting the new "quick
    reboot" config option in "dos" section (Wengier)
  - Added new "Reboot guest system" menu item (under
    "Main") to reboot the kernel of the integrated
    DOS or the guest DOS directly. The previous menu
    item "Reset guest system" has been renamed to
    "Reset virtual machine" which will restart the
    virtual machine in DOSBox-X instead. (Wengier)
  - Added "Reported DOS version" sub-menu (under
    "DOS") to dynamically change the reported DOS
    version (3.3, 5.0, 6.22, 7.1, or custom). This
    may enable/disable long filename (LFN) support
    with the default "lfn=auto" setting. (Wengier)
  - LS is now an external command appearing on drive
    Z: as LS.COM instead of a builtin shell command.
    This avoids name clash with game "Links LS 97"
    which has the main executable named LS.EXE. Also
    fixed minor issues in this command. (Wengier)
  - Fixed the game "Disney's Duck Tales: the Quest
    for Gold" not able to start. (Wengier)
  - Improved Configuration GUI's handling of "4dos"
    and "config" sections. Also added the "Save..."
    button just before the "Close" button. (Wengier)
  - Added "euro" config option (in [render] section)
    to display Euro symbol instead of the specified
    ASCII character in any code page. (Wengier)
  - PC-98 CG MMIO writes fixed to limit writes only
    to the user-defined areas, same as the IO writes.
    This fixes "Niko Niko" that appears to write a
    few too many 0xE1 bytes when filling text
    attribute RAM and into the CG MMIO region.
  - With -winrun command-line option or the setting
    "startcmd=true" (Windows only), you can now
    directly launch Windows programs on mounted local
    or overlay drives to run on the host. The option
    "startwait=false" can be used to disable waiting
    for Windows programs after started. This can also
    be toggled from the "DOS" menu. (Wengier)
  - Added START command to run commands on Windows
    host system. The /MAX, /MIN, /HID options can
    be used to run the specified program maximized,
    minimized, or hidden (they can be shortened to
    +, -, _ respectively). This command is disabled
    by default, but can be enabled by either the
    "startcmd" config option (in [dos] section) or
    the -winrun command-line option (which will also
    enable the CLIP$ device for Windows clipboard
    support). START will run commands listed in the
    "startincon" config option (separated by space)
    in the Windows Command Prompt and wait for a key
    press before exiting. (Wengier)
  - Added SHELL= option to the [config] section in
    dosbox-x.conf to specify an alternative shell,
    e.g. "SHELL=4DOS.COM". (Wengier)
  - Added built-in 4DOS 8.00 shell for 4DOS features
    and capabilities. There is now a [4dos] section
    in the dosbox-x.conf file to act as the 4DOS.INI
    config file if you use this shell. (Wengier)
  - Added "Mouse wheel movements" menu (under "Main")
    to enable or disable the mouse wheel movements
    to arrow (up/down etc) feature. (Wengier)
  - Added "Quick right mouse button copy/paste" menu
    item toggle to allow quick Windows clipboard copy
    and paste via the right mouse button without any
    key modifier that may have been specified by the
    config option "clip_key_modifier". (Wengier)
  - Fixed mounting a directory with command-line like
    "dosbox-x .", and fixed mounting disk images with
    spaces via the "Drive" menu on Windows. (Wengier)
  - Added "mountwarning" config setting so you could
    optionally disable the warning when attempting to
    mount C:\ in Windows or / otherwise. (Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT now assumes "-fs none" automatically if
    a drive number is specified instead of a drive
    letter. Moreover, it will assume the image file
    name "IMGMAKE.IMG" if no filename is specified by
    the user. Also improved the command's handling of
    El Torito floppy drives, e.g. you can use option
    "-bootcd d" instead of "-el-torito d". (Wengier)
  - IMGMAKE warning replaced to indicate a general
    incompatibility between MS-DOS/SCANDISK and
    cluster sizes 64KB or larger.
  - IMGMAKE command will now use the image file name
    "IMGMAKE.IMG" if no file name is specified (either
    in the mounted local directory or in the DOSBox-X
    program directory if the current directory is not
    a local directory). The command now also supports
    a -force option to force overwrite the image file
    if it already exists. Furthermore, IMGMAKE will
    delete the generated image file if an error occurs
    during the image file creation. (Wengier)
    
0.83.3
  - IMGMAKE can now generate FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32
    filesystems. New option "-fat" is added to select
    the filesystem for the disk image.
  - Fixed command-line like "./dosbox-x /dir/app.bat"
    not able to launch the specified program (Wengier)
  - Fixed bug in DIR command's /P option which might
    cause it to not work properly. (Wengier)
  - The default key modifier for the Windows clipboard
    copy & paste via the right mouse button feature is
    now "shift" instead of "disabled". (Wengier)
  - Single-stepping in the debugger with the 286 and
    8086 normal cores now works correctly when stepping
    over instructions with a segment prefix.
  - Pentium MMX instructions now only available for
    Pentium MMX or higher. Fixed the bug that allowed
    MMX instructions for Pentium and lower if programs
    ignored the CPUID feature bits. Also fixed Pentium
    MMX instructions so that they work in both 16-bit
    real mode and 32-bit protected mode to match how
    they work in real hardware (joncampbell123)
  - Updated DOSBox-X's implementation for Pentium MMX
    instructions to latest version by kekko (Wengier)
  - DOSBox-X will try to automatically run the program
    with LOADFIX if the error message "Packed file is
    corrupt" is detected. (Wengier)
  - MOUNT command can now mount a drive to the UNC
    root path in the form \\ComputerName\SharedFolder
    on Windows systems. (Wengier)
  - Improved the HX-DOS build package to make it fully
    automated: all required HX DOS Extender files will
    be included in the package, and dosbox-x.exe can
    now be run directly in a real DOS system without
    external requirements. (Wengier)
  - Fixed incorrect frame rate reported by 3Dfx Voodoo
    emulation (rderooy, backported from DOSBox SVN).
  - Added the "Boot from disk image" menu item (A:, C:,
    and D: drives only) in the "Drive" menu to boot the
    specified disk image directly in Windows. (Wengier)
  - Support for converting mouse wheel movements into
    keyboard presses like arrow keys, configurable by
    the option "mouse_wheel_key" (default is 0 which
    disables this feature). When set to 1, mouse wheel
    movements are converted to up/down arrows. Setting
    it to 2 or 3 converts such movements to left/right
    arrows or PageUp/PageDn keys respectively. (Wengier)
  - Support for reloading the keyboard mapper file with
    the config -set command. (Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT command without parameters will show disk
    names for drive-number only mounts. (Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT can now autodetect DOS <= 3.21 harddisk
    geometry with MFM sector images (rderooy & Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT -fs none fixed to use same geometry detect
    function that FAT filesystem mounting uses.
  - Added suppprt for mounting overlay drives using MOUNT
    command with "-t overlay" option. Backported from
    DOSBox SVN and adopted for DOSBox-X with additional
    features such as long filename and PC-98 support, it
    allows the users to redirect new and changed file(s)
    to a different location transparently. (Wengier)
  - Cleaned up the DPI awareness auto-detection code to
    allow Visual Studio builds to again run on Windows 7.
    Meanwhile, MinGW builds (either SDL1 or SDL2 version)
    are still required for Windows XP systems. (Wengier)
  - Updated Nuked OPL3 to latest version 1.8 for accurate
    OPL3 emulation (Wengier)
  - Added AUTOTYPE command to perform scripted keyboard
    entry into a running DOS program or game. Ported from
    DOSBox-staging, it can be used to reliably skip intro,
    provide input to answer initial startup or config
    questions, or conduct a simple demo. (Wengier)
  - Added code page 866 (Cyrillic Russian) to support
    host to guest code page mapping (tuffnatty)
  - Mouse buttons (left, middle, right) can now be mapped
    to keys in the keyboard mapper. (Wengier)
  - Support for mounting .cue files with MP3/OGG/WAV/FLAC
    compressed audio tracks. (Wengier) 
  - Rewrote the Windows installer for DOSBox-X, as well as
    the building script for the installer. All required
    build tools including the Inno Setup Compiler are now
    provided in the repository and will be automatically
    called by the building script. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "mapperfile_sdl2" for SDL2 builds.
    SDL1 and SDL2 builds of DOSBox-X can not use the same
    mapper file, or they will likely malfunction. Adding
    this option allows SDL1 and SDL2 builds of DOSBox-X
    to work with the same dosbox-x.conf file. (Wengier)
  - Added GUI menu option under "DOS" to change the long
    filename setting (enable, disable, or auto). (Wengier)
  - Improvements and fixes to the save/load state feature:
    It now supports Sound Blaster Goldplay mode;
    It now saves PC-98 FM interrupt state so that reloading
    state does not cause hung music;
    It is also fixed not to crash when used within a guest
    operting system (when the DOS kernel has been shut down
    using the BOOT command);
    It now supports memory size up to 1GB;
    It will save and verify the DOSBox-X version and build.
    States saved by DOSBox-X in one platform (e.g. 64-bit
    Windows) may not work in another (e.g. 32-bit Linux).
    The GUI menu will show if the save slot is empty, and if
    not the program name of save state will be displayed.
  - Re-ported and improved the save state feature for saving
    and loading states with support for up to 10 save slots.
    They can be selected from the "Capture" menu. (Wengier)
  - Added COUNTRY command to set country code for country-
    specific date and time formats. For example, the command
    "COUNTRY 61" sets the country code to 61 (International
    English) which uses the DD-MM-YYYY date format instead
    of the default (U.S.) MM-DD-YYYY date format. (Wengier)
  - DOS 440Dh IOCTL function 67h (get access flag) added to
    allow FDISK.EXE to determine FAT filesystem type. Also
    implemented function 40h (set device parameters) and
    function 46h (set volume serial number). (Wengier)
  - Unknown DOS 440Dh IOCTLs warnings now indicate whether
    triggered by call or query.
  - S3 VESA BIOS mode number for 1024x768 32bpp changed to
    avoid conflict with Windows 95 S3 driver and 800x600
    16bpp mode.
  - FAT driver no longer mounts FAT32 volumes unless the
    DOS version is 7.1 or higher, and it no longer mounts
    FAT16B LBA volumes unless the DOS version is 7.0 or
    higher. These are to mimic the MS-DOS behavior.
  - Fixed FAT driver not to attempt to mount partitions that
    have nothing to do with the FAT filesystem (such as
    type 0Dh and extended LBA partition tables). Also fixed
    the FAT driver to not assume partition start sector 63
    if it cannot identify a partition to use.
  - Added code to FAT driver to identify telltale pattern
    left by Microsoft FDISK when a partition is created (but
    not yet formatted) and reject.
0.83.2
  - Added help messages for some supported commands. (Wengier)
  - Added phone book support for the emulated modem. There is
    a new phonebookfile= option in the [serial] section. The
    phone book file entries need to be in the format of:
    "<dummy number> <hostname/ip:port>" e.g.
    5551234 cavebbs.homeip.net:23
    Thank NicknineTheEagle for implementing this feature.
  - Implemented the missing EMS subfunctions 52h and 59h by
    porting the patch that adds them (Wengier)
  - Fixed issues with the "config -wcd -all" command and other
    updates to the CONFIG command (Wengier)
  - Added [config] section in dosbox-x.conf to resemble DOS's
    CONFIG.SYS file. It currently supports REM, BREAK, NUMLOCK,
    FCBS, FILES, DOS, DEVICE/DEVICEHIGH, INSTALL/INSTALLHIGH,
    SET and LASTDRIVE commands. The file CONFIG.SYS will appear
    on the Z: drive, similar to AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The [config]
    section can be bypassed with the -noconfig command-line
    option or with the secure mode enabled (Wengier)
  - Moved PC-98 related config options (starting with "pc-98 ")
    from [dosbox] and [dos] sections to its own [pc98] section.
    These options in existing dosbox-x.conf/dosbox.conf files
    will be automatically redirected to the [pc98] section from
    the other sections when DOSBox-X starts (Wengier)
  - The user directory DOSBox-X uses has been changed to use the
    DOSBox-X directory (e.g. from ~/.dosbox to ~/.config/dosbox-x
    on Linux platform). It will be read *after* the dosbox-x.conf
    file in the current directory (Wengier)
  - Config option "dpi aware" now supports the "auto" setting
    to auto-decide on the best setting for the platform. This
    fixes very small window issue on high DPI devices such as
    Microsoft Surface tablets. (Wengier)
  - Added DTASEG, DTAOFF, and PSPSEG as hex value constants to
    the debugger interface to aid in debugging DOS programs.
  - New command-line option -helpdebug added to list debug-
    related command-line options. The standard -? / -h / -help
    command-line option will no longer list them (Wengier)
  - Implemented LFN support for FAT driver, so that it is now
    possible to view directory list, create or open files and
    directories etc with long filenames on FAT12/16/32 drives
    just like on mounted local drives.
  - FAT driver cleaned up and fixed to avoid edge cases that
    can corrupt directory entries and leave lost clusters
    on the disk, also fixed to always report root directory
    as a directory through the GetFileAttribute INT 21h call,
    needed by MOVE.EXE and XCOPY.EXE to work properly.
  - IMGMOUNT auto geometry detection will assume LBA disk
    and fake C/H/S geometry if the disk is 4GB or larger,
    the MBR lacks executable code, or the first partition
    is Windows 98-style LBA FAT16 or FAT32.
  - IMGMOUNT now assumes ISO type by default if the image file
    extension is .iso/.cue/.bin/.mdf. No need for "-t iso" in
    this case; but (if appliable) it can be overridden by for
    example "-t hdd". (Wengier)
  - IMGMOUNT command (no parameters) now lists mounted FAT/ISO
    drives and mounted drive numbers, also SUBST command (no
    parameters) now lists mounted local drives (Wengier)
  - INT AH=36h fixed to convert free space but maintain a
    cluster size (bytes/sector * sectors/cluster) that is less
    than 64KB to avoid divide by 0 crashes with FORMAT.COM /S
  - Added FAT32 free/total disk space API for FAT driver, and
    updated INT 21h AX=7303h to call it. FAT driver now provides
    FAT32 extended disk free/total through FAT32 API and 2GB
    limited free/total through INT 21h AH=36h for older DOS
    programs. Shell DIR command updated to use FAT32 free space
    API to show free space even on FAT32 partitions larger than
    2GB, but only if the DOS version is set to 7.1 or higher.
  - Added FAT32 INT21h and IOCTLs needed by MS-DOS 7.1/Windows 98
    versions of SCANDISK.EXE and FORMAT.COM, such as DOS functions
    for "FAT32 extended" absolute disk read and write.
  - Improved FAT32 support to the FAT driver, including direct
    support for FAT32 drives in the DOSBox-X command shell. Files,
    directories and volume labels on FAT32 drives can be listed,
    read from or written to just like on FAT12/16 drives.
  - Added DOS IOCTL read/write logical device track functions so
    that FORMAT.COM is able to verify and modify the partition table
    to successfully format a hard drive image. Also added stub to
    DOS IOCTL "format device track" for FORMAT.COM.
  - You can now force unmount a drive and then mount it to a new
    directory in one command, e.g. "MOUNT C C:\DOS -U" (Wengier)
  - REN command can now rename directories (in addition to files) on
    FAT drives just like on local drives (Wengier)
  - Several improvements to DEL command, such as a new /F option to
    force delete of read-only files, and improved handling when the
    argument is a directory (Wengier)
  - LS command added to list directory contents. It does not support
    all options as in Unix/Linux platform (Wengier)
  - DIR /O & /OG supported in addition to /ON|/OE|/OS|/OD options.
    Options such as /-O & /-A can be used to override /O, /A etc if
    they are specified in the DIRCMD environment varaible (Wengier)
  - DIR and VOL commands now display real serial numbers for mounted
    local drives (Windows only) and FAT drives (Wengier)
  - Fixed SYS command not working properly (Wengier)
  - DOS kernel INT 21h function Set File Attribute no longer
    allows changing volume label attributes and fixes directory
    attributes in order to prevent filesystem corruption.
    This prevents Windows 95 Setup from creating WINBOOT.INI
    and then changing it into a directory with the call.
  - FAT driver bugs fixed where a newly created zero length file
    combined with a lseek() can corrupt filesytem structures
    (root directory and/or the second FAT table). This fixes
    filesystem corruption when running Windows 95 install.
  - Enabled printer emulation for non-Windows OSes (Linux,
    Mac OS X, etc.). FreeType2 is required to enable
    printer emulation at compile time.
  - Added command-line option "-o" for MOUNT command so that
    it can be specified whether to report mounted local drives
    as remote (network) drives. It is "auto" by default just
    like the virtual drive Z:.
  - Added config option "drive z is remote" in dosbox-x.conf
    to report drive Z: as a remote (network) drive. It is
    "auto" by default, which will try to prevent SCANDISK.EXE
    from Windows 9x installs to scan and "repair" drive Z:
    which is not backed by a disk filesystem.
  - Fixed clip_key_modifier setting not working when it is
    set to alt, ctrl or shift in the SDL2 build. (Wengier)
  - Sending "Ctrl+Alt+Del" key from the menu will now reset
    the system within DOSBox-X when the intergrated DOS or a
    real DOS booted from a disk image is active. (Wengier)
  - PC speaker output fixed not to timeout and stop rendering
    unless the PC speaker output is not emitting anything
    audible anyway (Fix for Sopwith 1 and 2).
  - Added ALIAS command to define or display aliases.
  - "HELP command" now works the same as "command /?" for
    supported internal commands. (Wengier)
  - Improved handling of quotes in some commands. (Wengier)
  - Added -set command-line option to change config options.
    It can be specified multiple times for multiple options,
    overriding any options in the config file. For example,
    the command "dosbox-x.exe -set machine=pc98" will force
    DOSBox-X to start in PC-98 mode. (Wengier)
  - Re-added full drive menu items for the Windows platform.
    The "Boot from drive" item (A:, C: and D: drives only)
    should work in other platforms too. The BOOT command is
    also improved to allow e.g. "BOOT A:" to work. (Wengier)
  - INT 10h vector now points into VGA BIOS as a workaround
    for DOS programs that use vector location as part of
    their EGA/VGA detection. This fixes blink attribute
    and EGA/VGA detection failure with SuperCalc 3 and
    SuperCalc 4. This option, enabled by default, can be
    disabled or enabled from dosbox-x.conf.
  - Improved long filename (LFN) and SetFileAttr/GetFileAttr
    support for PC-98 mode. (Wengier)
  - Added config option "lfn" to enable/disable long filename
    (LFN) support. With default setting of "auto", LFN support
    is enabled if the reported DOS version is at least 7.0.
  - Added config option "automountall" (default: false) to
    automatically mount all available Windows drives (Wengier)
  - The copy & paste Windows clipboard text via the right
    mouse button feature now has support for PC-98 mode too
    in addition to other modes. (Wengier)
  - MPU401 IRQ fixed to properly default to 2 or 9 in IBM
    PC/XT/AT mode depending on the "enable slave pic" config
    option (rderooy)
  - Fluidsynth defaults fixed for better more reliable audio
    streaming on Linux and Mac OS X (Wengier and rderooy)
  - Improved support for FluidSynth MIDI device by porting
    code from DOSBox ECE. Set "mididevice=fluidsynth" along
    with other required options such as "fluid.soundfont"
    in dosbox-x.conf to use it. The previous config setting
    "mididevice=synth" is still supported for alternative
    implementation of FluidSynth. (Wengier)

0.83.1
  - dosbox-x.conf is now recognized as the default config
    file name in addition to dosbox.conf. The sample config
    file "dosbox.reference.conf" has been renamed to
    "dosbox-x.reference.conf" as well (Wengier)
  - Sound Blaster emulation fixed to better handle Goldplay
    mode detection false positive in 1994 demoscene demo
    myth_dw.zip when using Sound Blaster Pro setting in
    the demo. The initial state before music starts is
    like Goldplay mode, but when music actually starts the
    DMA programmed to normal state without restarting
    DMA playback.
  - Tandy DAC output fixed to slowly ramp last sample to
    zero DC sample (128) when switched off. This fixes
    loud popping (DC offset) problems with Tandy DAC
    sound effects in Prince of Persia. This new behavior
    also seems to match real Tandy 1000 hardware according
    to video captures of it's audio/video outputs while
    playing Prince of Persia on it.
  - Tandy/PCjr 3-voice fixed to respond to I/O port 0xC0
    regardless of 8-bit or 16-bit I/O (fixes Prince of
    Persia).
  - Write-protecting a disk image in IMGMOUNT and BOOT
    commands now supported by putting a leading colon (:)
    before the image file name. Works with disk swapping;
    e.g. "BOOT :C:\DISK1.IMG C:\DISK2.IMG" only write-
    protects C:\DISK1.IMG but not C:\DISK2.IMG. The new
    config option "leading colon write protect image" can
    be used to disable or enable this behavior (Wengier)
  - Support for changing DOSBox-X internal time (Wengier)
  - Support for pipes (|), e.g. "DIR | MORE" should now
    work as expected; it is recommended to set the %TEMP%
    (or %TMP%) environment variable to a writable directory
    inside DOSBox-X before using pipes (Wengier)
  - Improved redirections using "<" or ">" (Wengier)
  - Improved Ctrl+C handling in some commands (Wengier)
  - Improved Tab completion in the command shell (Wengier)
  - Improved -get & -set options for the CONFIG command,
    e.g. support for config options with spaces (Wengier)
  - Improved REN (or RENAME) command to support wildcards
    (* and ?) in the source and/or target files (Wengier)
  - Some improvements to commands like MORE & VER (Wengier)
  - Added BREAK, VERIFY and TRUENAME commands as in a real
    DOS system. Type "[command] /?" for help info (Wengier)
  - Implemented FOR command to run a specified command for
    each file in a set of files. Also added LFNFOR command
    to control whether to use long filenames in the FOR
    command as in MS-DOS 7+ (Wengier)
  - Implemented ATTRIB command to view and set attributes
    of files or directories (Wengier)
  - Added emulation of R (readonly) attribute bit for
    Linux and Unix systems through the user-writable
    file mode bits of the filesystem.
  - Fixed PC DOS 2000 crash during installation.
  - PC speaker: Mode 3 (square wave) and a counter value
    of 1 produces a low frequency square wave. Ulrasonic
    frequencies do not begin until count == 2. This fixes
    helicopter noises in Paratrooper.
  - Fixed PC speaker emulation to allow higher PC speaker
    frequencies (10x the value of pcrate) to reduce
    hiss/noise/aliasing noise that occurs when games
    program ultrasonic frequencies into the counter to
    "silence" the speaker. "Titus the Fox Marrakech and
    Back" should no longer have audible hissing noises
    between beeps when the game is using the PC speaker.
  - Increased DOS device limit, to avoid E_Exit() crash
    if all LPT and COM devices are enabled along with
    the new CLIP$ device.
  - Minimum MCB free default changed to better reflect
    a typical MS-DOS setup with minimal to no drivers.
    This should result in a report of 600K-ish memory
    free, which is equivalent to Windows 95 without
    anything loaded except COMMAND.COM.
  - DIR command now supports /S (search all directories)
    as well as /A, /AS, /A-S, /AH, /A-H, /AR, /A-R, /AA,
    /A-A options for file attribute support; Note that
    DIR /A shows all files and directories whereas DIR
    alone (without /A) shows all except system/hidden
    ones as in a real DOS system (Wengier)
  - DIR command now shows the real free disk space on
    local drives. It is possible to limit this free space
    for certain programs with the -freesize option of
    MOUNT command. A new config option "freesizecap" is
    added to change the behavior of this option (Wengier)	
  - DIR command fixed to show the volume label of the
    drive you are listing, instead of always the current
    drive (rderooy)
  - Various improvements to DEL and COPY commands, e.g.
    fixed the DEL /P option having no effect, and "DEL ."
    deleted all files in the current directory silently;
    the COPY command now asks for confirmation before
    overwriting files, and it now supports /Y and /-Y
    options to change this behavior, which can also be
    set from the COPYCMD environment variable. (Wengier)
  - Added or fixed help information and/or error messages
    for some commands. (Wengier) 
  - Added support for DOS programs to communicate
    with the clipboard in Windows builds. If the
    "dos clipboard device enable" setting in
    dosbox-x.conf is set to "true" or "full", a DOS
    device (default name: CLIP$) will be added to
    allow bidirectional communications with the
    clipboard (e.g. "DIR >CLIP$" will write the
    output to the clipboard, and "TYPE CLIP$" will
    show the clipboard contents). Alternatively,
    you can set it to "read" or "write" to allow
    only read or write access for security reasons.
    The DOS device name can also be changed with
    the "dos clipboard device name" setting in
    dosbox-x.conf. (Wengier)
  - Added support for using the right mouse button
    to copy and paste from the Windows clipboard; the
    config option "clip_key_modifier" can be used to
    change the keyboard modifier such as none, alt, ctrl,
    shift, or disable this feature (default). (Wengier)
  - Updated the PasteClipboard feature in SDL1 build
    to support Unicode text translations; also fixed this
    feature not working in SDL2 build. The config option
    "clip_paste_speed" is added to speed up or slow down
    the pasting speed for different DOS programs (Wengier)
  - Support for DOSLIB2's w95sysrg/w95sysrs utils to
    get/set system registry location in DOS 7+. (Wengier)
  - Long filename support added, adapted from
    the vDosPlus project. It will be enabled with
    an initial DOS version of 7.0 or higher. (Wengier)
  - Corrected return value when using option to
    fake the installation of SHARE. (Allofich)
  - Added code to EMS emulation to print specific
    debug information when a PC-98 specific call is
    made to remap segment B000h to either system
    memory or video memory. I do not have enough
    test cases or a setup to test what really happens,
    so it will remain a debug message for now.
  - Added dosbox-x.conf option to allow emulation of a
    DOS environment that lacks ANSI.SYS. NOTE: The
    option has no effect in PC-98 mode.
  - INT 2Fh now responds to AX=1A00h which is an installation
    check to report whether ANSI.SYS is resident.
  - Added INT 21h debug logging for file I/O and general
    INT 21h usage [patch by ognjenmi]. Added enables for
    the logging which are off by default since the INT 21h
    and file I/O logging are fairly noisy under normal
    usage.

0.83.0
  - Added mt32.romdir dosbox.conf configuration option
    for users who store the MT32 ROMs elsewhere other
    than the current working directory.
  - Configuration GUI settings menu is now vertically
    divided to ensure that it fits on the screen even
    if the window is at minimum size.
  - PC-98 GDC status fixed to follow the explicit
    definition of one bit as hblank and the other
    as vsync instead of carrying over VGA port 3DAh
    style logic of hblank/vblank vs vsync. This
    fixes the BPS logo scanline effects in PC-98
    game 'frontier-universe-bps-neo-kobe-pc98-ia'
  - Added dosbox.conf option to select between two
    known behaviors in PC-98 mode regarding the PC
    speaker and the PIT timer. The default behavior
    follows the newer hardware, the alternate setting
    is for older games written against the PC-9801
    behavior.
  - Added dosbox.conf option nocachedir which, when
    set, instructs MOUNT to automatically act as if
    -nocachedir were given.
  - Linux/X11 SDL1 builds fixed not to issue resize
    commands to the window to avoid fighting the
    window manager. This prevents "spastic resizing"
    under Gnome 3 in Centos 8.
  - Source tree now includes build script for Linux
    users who prefer Clang/LLVM over GCC.
0.82.26
  - Debugger console window fixed to choose a smaller
    default size in Windows builds.
  - Debugger console window now resizes properly
    in Windows builds.
  - Using F10 (step over) in the debugger to step
    over INT 21h when a breakpoint for INT 21h is
    set now works correctly, instead of letting the
    instruction pointer "stick" there without moving.
  - Debugger interface now shows (running/watching)
    while RUNWATCH is active.
  - Debugger interface now correctly shows (running)
    status when F5 is used to resume emulation.
  - Debugger toggle reverts back to debugger interface
    instead of running state if triggered during a
    RUNWATCH command.
  - Fixed RUWNATCH command, which was broken by another
    fix sometime back designed to stop PIC event
    processing while in the debugger.
  - Debugger interface fixed to keep the SDL event
    handling going during the "pager" routine to
    prevent Windows from graying out the main window
    as "not responding" in Windows 7/8/10.
  - Direct3D support has been fixed to properly render
    pixel shaders again that were already written for
    other forks.
  - Added "Rescan all drives" menu command and mapper
    shortcut (Issue #1379 requested by saintfrater)
0.82.25
  - Added 1920x1440 4:3 HD VESA BIOS mode and increased
    scaler limits to support it.
  - VESA BIOS emulation now rejects video modes that
    exceed the render scaler architecture's limits,
    to avoid frozen screens if set. However, VESAMOED.COM
    warns the user, so if the user ignores the warning,
    VESA BIOS emulation will allow user-defined modes
    that exceed the limits anyway.
  - VESAMOED.COM will now warn you if the custom mode
    you modified exceeds the render scaler's limits.
  - VGA emulation now reports render scaler limits
    in the logfile at startup, if debug logging is
    enabled.
  - Render scaler code now logs a warning when it
    rejects a video mode that exceeds the render
    scaler limits.
  - S3 emulation now allows 16MB of video memory.
  - Due to continuous problems with DOS games and a
    very long VESA modelist, the defaults for VESA
    BIOS options in dosbox.conf have been changed to
    limit the modelist to something a late 1990s
    VESA BIOS would list. New defaults include a
    maximum resolution of 1280x1024, the removal of
    4bpp 16-color packed, unusual video modes,
    "High Definition" TV broadcast modes, and the
    extra explicitly defined 24bpp modes to complement
    VBE1.2 32bpp modes. Those options remain
    changeable and all limits can be lifted with
    settings in dosbox.conf if wanted.
  - Allow using "" in the debugger to specify that
    a hex value should be used rather than the
    contents of the flag with that name. Allows
    hex values of AC, AF, CF and DF to be directly
    specified. (Allofich)
  - 25.COM, 28.COM, and 50.COM now have different
    versions for VGA, EGA, and other IBM compatible
    video machines. 28.COM now correctly sets 28 lines
    for machine=ega. CGA/MDA/Hercules/etc. still use
    INT AX=3h for 25.COM.
  - Change 25.COM to use INT 10h AX=1114h (8x16) instead
    of INT 10h AX=3 (set 80x25 mode).
  - INT 10h AX=1111h (8x14) and AX=1113h (8x8), related
    to 28.COM and 50.COM, now range check the current
    cursor row against number of rows to keep it on
    screen.
  - Fixed ADDKEY "full" command not turning on the
    full core when used with a delay. (Allofich)
  - INT 10h AX=101Ah Get Video DAC color-page state fixed
    to restore display after blanking it due to Attribute
    Controller read and write operations. This fixes
    IBM PC compatible MS-DOS game "Blue Force".
  - Debugger: "VGA AC" now shows AC disable bits as well
    as the internal state indicating whether the last
    byte written to 3C0h was handled as the index.
0.82.24
  - FDC emulation now allows READ command to look for
    sector numbers that are out of range in order to
    support booter games that read out of range sector
    numbers as part of their copy protection.
  - Windows SDL1 window resizing fixed to avoid snapping
    and jumping issues when the window is sized down
    to the point the menu bar doubles or triples in
    height due to menu item wrapping.
  - FDC clear DMA terminal count automatically (with a
    warning printed to the log) at beginning of FDC
    read/write (PC-98 booter game Star Cruiser).
  - FDC DMA read/write failure now causes FDC to signal
    an error, and the debug output will say so.
  - FDC debug output now shows motor bits in the correct
    order, not backwards
  - CONFIG.COM and MIXER.COM are now registered only at
    DOS kernel startup, to resolve their disappearance
    after RE-DOS or guest system reset.
  - Some OpenGL cleanup and fixes for when compiling for
    Mac OS X Catalina.
  - Shell startup now prints the actual mapper binding
    (whatever it is) for the Host key instead of assuming
    F12/F11.
  - "Ro" key in PC-98 mode in the mapper interface now
    clarifies that it is Ro / _ since the shift state is
    the underscore.
  - Shell startup code fixed to show F11 for Windows and
    F12 for other platforms properly instead of always
    showing F11.
  - Added BOOT option --pc98-graphics to start up with
    graphics layer enabled in order to run HDI images
    using QMOUSE and games that expect NEC MOUSE.COM
    behavior of showing graphics layer on driver init.
  - BOOT now hides graphics layer on startup in PC-98 mode
    to reflect real hardware.
  - INT 33h mouse emulation now enables graphics layer
    on mouse startup and INT 33h AX=0 to imitate NEC
    MOUSE.COM behavior seen on real PC-98 hardware. This is
    needed for some Orange House games that assume this
    behavior, without which the graphics are invisible.
  - INT 33h define range functions now include separate
    range correction for text mode vs graphics mode.
  - Help sections in Configuration GUI have been improved,
    they are now easier to browse and read. (aybe)
  - CONFIG: added description for 'securemode' (aybe).
  - Integer properties are now correctly saved when
    they have been changed in configuration GUI (aybe).
  - Some scenarios with command history could display
    garbage characters from previous/next command (aybe).
  - Fixed all hard disk images created by IMGMAKE having
    VHD footers. (Allofich)
  - Windows Visual Studio solution: (aybe)
    - cleaned and clarified project properties for projects
    - removed configurations that didn't make sense
    - fixed broken debugging
    - consolidated to use single versions of SDK and IDE
    - enabled faster builds (multi-processor compilation)
    - fixed broken builds, e.g. ARM, ARM64
0.82.23
  - Serial and parallel file output now disable stdio
    buffering so that output is more immediately
    accessible to the user.
  - Added file output to serial port emulation.
  - Parallel port emulation now support both dev: and
    file: to specify that LPTx output go to a file,
    not necessarily a device by name.
  - Fixed bug that capped vmemsizekb to 8KB.
  - BIOS bootup screen now shows correct text for CPU
    type instead of "? CPU" when cputype=auto.
  - PC-98 256-color mode fixed to ignore doublescan
    and 200-line bits of the GDC to match real hardware
    behavior. This fixes display problems with
    "Alone in the Dark"
  - BOOT command will now always set 640x200 8-color
    graphics mode when booting PC-98 disk images,
    to match the apparent behavior of real hardware.
  - PC-98 hardware apparently allows writing port 6Ah
    to jump directly to 256-color mode from 8-color
    mode, update DOSBox-X emulation to allow it.
    This fixes the PC-9821 port of "Alone in the Dark".
  - Slow CGA memory access handler now wraps to 16KB
    correctly, and resolves a segfault that can happen
    if the last 16KB is accessed by the guest if
    vmemsizekb=16.
  - vmemsize default is now -1, which means to pick a
    video memory size automatically.
  - Added PC-98 INT 1Bh AH=03h SCSI BIOS command, which
    allows FreeDOS98 to boot.
  - INT 33h emulation fixed not to reset mouse min/max
    range if the new video mode is a VESA BIOS SVGA
    mode (not a standard VGA mode). Some games seem to
    define the mouse min/max range AND THEN set the
    VESA BIOS mode, not the other way around.
  - INT 33h define range functions now apply rounding
    to the max range if the range is close to the
    dimensions of the screen, for games like Daggerfall
    that set the cursor maximum range to values close to,
    but not exactly, the dimensions of the VGA screen.
  - INT 33h define range functions updated to accept max
    ranges for mapping host to guest if set just after
    video modeset or if those INT 33h functions are called
    when no mouse buttons are down.
  - INT 10h AH=4Fh AL=08h (Set DAC width) now correctly
    set AL=4Fh to indicate the call is supported.
  - VGA DAC palette writes are now ALWAYS masked to 6-bit
    unless 8-BIT DAC mode is ON and enabled. This fixes
    palette problems with Amulets and Armor.
  - VGA DAC 6/8-bit palette management code simplified
  - Added dosbox.conf option to instruct DOSBox-X to leave
    the PC speaker clock gate enabled if set, for games
    that use that PIT output as a time source. Setting
    the option to "true" allows "Bàoxiào sānguózhì", a game
    with strange and elaborate timing code, to run without
    hanging at the second title screen.
  - VGA port 3DAh "undefined bits" setting changed to 0x04
    to accomodate "Blues Brothers"
  - Configuration GUI: If the settings are scrollable,
    tabbing between fields will now auto-scroll to the
    field and make it visible.
  - In the configuration GUI, scroll wheel input no longer
    changes the window focus.
  - Set CPU cycles dialog box layout fixed.
  - Added 'skip encoding unchanged frames' option to
    dosbox.conf. If set, AVI video capture will skip
    video frame compression if the frame has not changed
    from the previous frame. Option is off by default
    at this time in case it causes any issues with users
    and their video editing software.
0.82.22
  - Added Normal2x render scalers so that 'force scaler'
    for 1x2 or 2x1 scalefactors works and you can scale
    up 320x200/640x200 VGA modes and 640x200 CGA modes
    by 2x.
  - Main window titlebar now reflects whether or
    not the debugger interface is active.
  - Debugger interface now flushes terminal input
    upon entering the debugger, so that keyboard
    input prior to entering the debugger is ignored.
  - Debugger mapper shortcut and menu item are now
    a toggle. Selecting once will enter the debugger
    and selecting again will resume emulation.
  - cycles=max now displays cycle percentage correctly
    instead of showing e.g. 100 cyc/ms
  - (Allofich) Note and ignore INT 33, AX=53C1 call
    for the Logitech CyberMan.
  - Fixed odd code addition that disabled (through
    the configuration) XMS, EMS, and UMB when
    booting a guest OS. This fixes a problem where
    those services are not available when rebooting
    back into the DOSBox-X shell from a guest OS.
  - CGA 640x200 and MCGA 640x480 modes fixed to
    have proper refresh rate when machine=mcga,
    instead of 140Hz.
  - MCGA horizontal active display register
    encodes N - 1, not N, according to real
    hardware register dumps.
  - INT 10h modes 2 and 3 updated set MCGA CRTC
    write protect bit, to match real PS/2 hardware
    behavior, and to unlock CRTC registers during
    mode set.
  - PC-98 VSYNC interrupt now fires at vertical
    retrace start (as documented) instead of at
    active display end behavior borrowed from
    DOSBox VGA emulation. This fixes "Tonight"
    by Swat.
  - Fixed mistake that placed N88 ROM BASIC stub
    (something specific to PC-98) in memory even
    in IBM PC/XT/AT emulation mode.
  - Fixed some callback slot leaks that can cause
    DOSBox-X to run out of callback slots if you
    reset the guest system too much.
  - Fixed invalid callback and errant interrupt
    handling during BIOS reset delay that happens
    if you use the keyboard shortcut to trigger
    system reset.
  - XMS emulation resets global enable and local
    enable state on XMS emulation startup to fix
    crashes related to inability to control A20 gate
    after system reset or DOS kernel restart.
  - Debugger "SM" command now accepts segment:offset
    syntax for memory location to write.
  - Fixed INT 21h AH=65h bug that returns DBCS table
    for AH=4h that should return filename uppercase
    table.
  - Configuration GUI property settings are now
    shown in a single column wide list with scrolling.
  - In the configuration GUI, help dialogs will now
    present the help text as a scrollable region if
    there is too much to fit on screen.
  - dosbox.conf mixer rate will now accept any
    sample rate from 4KHz to 192KHz instead of only
    fixed specific sample rates.
  - cascade interrupt ignore in service setting now
    accepts true, false, and auto. "auto" is now the
    default, and will choose true or false depending
    on machine type for correct emulation either way.
    It should no longer be necessary to add
    "cascade interrupt ignore in service=true" to
    your dosbox.conf every time you want to run a
    PC-98 game properly.
  - PC-98 FM board emulation will now load SOUND.ROM
    into segment CC00h if available, if FM board
    emulation is enabled.
  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=30h updated to return AH=05h
    AL=00h BH=00h if success, AH=00h AL=01h BH=01h
    if failure. This is needed to get Puyo Puyo 2
    to work, which for some reason fails if a call
    to set 15KHz mode works.
  - PC-98 LIO and SOUND BIOS entry points, while
    still not implemented, have been updated to
    print the name of the call according to an
    online reference.
  - DOS FCB rename now supports renaming the
    volume label as MS-DOS does.
  - Fixed bug that prevented proper DOS FCB rename
    if the FCB used to rename is extended.
  - FAT filesystem driver updated to also store
    updated volume label in the boot sector of the
    partition, as per MS-DOS FAT standards.
  - FCB create can now be used to set a FAT
    filesystem label. MS-DOS LABEL.EXE works
    correctly now.
  - FAT filesystem driver now allows LABEL command
    to change the FAT volume label of mounted disk
    images.
  - DOS kernel updated to support basic FCB methods
    of deleting/setting the volume label, at least
    on local folder mounts.
  - DOS kernel will now return the volume label of
    FAT filesystems mounted from disk images.
  - LABEL setting code fixed not to treat label as
    if an 8.3 filename.
  - LABEL is no longer a builtin shell command and
    appears on drive Z: as LABEL.COM
  - LABEL reimplemented to imitate MS-DOS behavior
    with regard to how it handles the command line.
  - File I/O checking and cleanup (Allofich)
  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)
    - Handle errant IRQs as a real BIOS does. Also
    remove r3263 workaround, as it's no longer
    needed.
    - Fix flag behavior of several shift/rotate
    instructions, cause exceptions and fix
    potential 'pop ss' problems
    - Add support for Print Screen key and
    interrupt. In-game screenshot feature
    of Descent and Descent 2 now works.
0.82.21
  - Reduced title bar size of the Configuration GUI.
  - Fixed sizing and positions of some Help menu dialog
    boxes in the Configuration GUI.
  - Configuration GUI issues with help text and word
    wrap running off the edge of the window have been
    fixed.
  - INT 21h AX=3702h AVAILDEV returns DL=FFh to match
    MS-DOS behavior.
  - Added INT 21h AX=6523h, for Microsoft software
    that uses it after prompting the user for a Y/N
    answer such as FORMAT.COM and FDISK.EXE
  - PC-98 MS-DOS kernel now writes fake INT 1Bh device
    list to 60:6C to satisfy certain games that need
    it for their "master disk" detection.
  - Fixed FAT driver bug that caused the allocation
    of an extra cluster if writing a file that is
    exactly a multiple of the cluster size long.
  - FAT driver now assigns current date/time when
    creating directories.
  - Increased the DTA segment size of the DOS FAT driver
    to fix problems with directory searches corrupting
    adjacent memory.
  - Disk Parameter Block linked list now terminates
    with next pointer at FFFF:FFFF instead of 0000:0000
    to match general DOS pattern and satisfy some
    PC-98 games that enumerate the list.
  - INT AH=52h List of Lists now points to the Disk
    Parameter Block as well, which allows some PC-98
    games that enumerate the list to work.
  - Video parameter list and table at BIOS DATA AREA
    40:A8 added to MCGA mode, to match real PS/2 MCGA
    hardware.
  - FAT driver now updates the Disk Parameter
    Block when activated, and provides as much
    from the FAT filesystem as possible. It is now
    possible to run Microsoft MS-DOS 6.22
    SCANDISK.EXE on a drive letter attached from
    a disk image.
  - Disk Parameter Block is now the proper full
    size. The limited 9 bytes/block hackery has
    been removed.
  - Added INT 25h/INT 26h emulation for FAT drives
    mounted with IMGMOUNT.
  - Fake disk paramter table fixed to indicate one
    reserved sector.
  - Fixed INT 25h/INT 26h to return an error rather than
    silently fail with success. Emulation of these calls
    exist currently only as stubs and, according to
    source comments, as a workaround for MicroProse
    installers. For disk diagnostic software like
    Microsoft ScanDisk it is better to signal an error
    until INT 25h/INT 26h are fully implemented.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to control whether INT 10h
    VESA BIOS function AX=4F00h (Get SVGA information)
    zeros the entire 256-byte or 512-byte structure or
    not. Turning the option off (no zeroing) allows
    "Get Saddam!" to run with SVGA and VESA BIOS
    extensions enabled without crashing. The developer
    calls INT AX=4F00h but does not provide enough
    storage space for the full 256 byte structure,
    only enough for the base structure defined by VESA.
  - INT 2Fh updated to explicitly mention SMARTDRV or
    DBLSPACE if values of AX are known to match their
    API.
  - VESA BIOS modelist now includes S3 OEM video modes
    as documented by the RBIL, and needed by Line Wars II.
  - OpenGL output now clears 3 frames instead of 2 after
    mode change to deal with nVidia hardware that
    reportedly triple buffers OpenGL rendering in
    Windows.
  - INT 21h fixed to always enable the A20 gate through
    HIMEM.SYS if dosbox.conf indicates a configuration where
    XMS is enabled, the HMA is enabled, and DOS is loaded
    high (DOS=HIGH), which is the default configuration
    for DOSBox-X.
  - XMS emulation fixed not to allow conventional memory
    block addresses (source or dest) if it extends past
    the 1MB+64KB-16 range normally accessible from real
    mode, as per Microsoft XMS test program.
  - XMS emulation fixed to disallow XMS block move/copy
    with an odd length byte count, per Microsoft XMS
    specification.
  - XMS emulation no longer allows freeing a XMS block
    handle that is still locked, as per Microsoft XMS
    specification and testing software.
  - Enhance existing INT 68h fix for "PopCorn" by adding
    a dosbox.conf option to always keep INT 68h NULL,
    so that it's possible to run the game in machine
    configurations other than CGA.
  - EGA/VGA: Fix "dynamic parameter save area" pointer,
    to make sure it's initialized to zero properly.
    This is needed to run "Get Saddam!" in VGA mode
    without crashing.
  - INT 10h AH=12h BL=10h no longer responds in
    machine=mcga mode, which allows Thexder to run in
    256-color mode properly when emulating MCGA.
  - Added code to silence the PC speaker, if it was left
    on at reset, at BIOS POST.
  - Added pause at BIOS POST (after reset), with
    dosbox.conf option to control, so that screen contents
    at reset can be seen.
  - Writes to unmapped 0xE0000-0xE7FFF in PC-98 mode no
    longer print a "write to ROM" warning. PC-98 games
    and software like to zero that region whether or not
    the 4th bitplane is enabled.
  - PC speaker emulation now takes into consideration
    the case when the 8254 timer has been given a control
    word without a counter value, in which case no sound
    is to be emitted until a control word is written.
    This fixes "Titus the Fox: To Marrakech and Back"
    when the game fails to detect Adlib (OPL2) hardware.
  - Adlib polling hack no longer needed.
  - Floppy controller emulation fixed to support sector
    sizes other than 512 bytes per sector.
  - Floppy controller fixed to always set "seek completed"
    status bit after seek/calibrate, not just when the
    head hits track 0 (programming mistake).
  - PC-98 40-column text mode is now supported.
  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)
    - In the mapper, display disabled items or events
    with no binding in grey. 
    - Implemented BIOS beep sound for ASCII character 7
    - Return failure for INT 13 format calls if the
    drive is inactive.
0.82.20
  - Dynamic core IMUL instruction mistake fixed,
    signed multiply works properly again.
  - PC-98 graphics emulation fixed to render only the
    number of active display lines programmed into
    the GDC instead of matching the text layer. This
    fixes the status bar at the bottom of the screen
    in "First Queen" and "First Queen II".
  - Normal CPU core fixed not to immediately process
    interrupts on STI but to wait a little bit so that
    a STI + CLI sequence does not cause interrupt
    processing, according to real Intel 486 behavior.
  - Unknown interrupts in PC-98 mode are now routed by
    the DOS kernel through it's segment (60h) and back
    to the BIOS through a JMP instruction. It appears
    some TSRs for PC-98 determine whether or not
    interrupts are in use by whether or not the segment
    value is pointing at the DOS kernel (segment 60h).
  - Re-added a20=fast by popular demand, though a20=mask
    is still the default. a20=fast emulates the A20 gate
    the way a virtual 8086 mode monitor does where only
    the first 64KB past 1MB is remapped rather than
    gating bit 20 of all addresses. Note that a20=fast
    also matches the A20 gate behavior in DOSBox SVN.
  - Bringing up the SDL drawn menus and then resizing the
    window no longer "freezes" the display in SDL2 builds.
  - IDE emulation now minimally emulates PC-98 I/O port
    arrangement in PC-98 mode.
  - Running a build that draws it's own menus, setting
    output=opengl, and hiding the menus no longer causes
    lag redrawing the screen every time the mouse cursor
    moves.
  - Memory limit is now 3.5GB for 64-bit builds and 1GB for
    32-bit builds.
  - Maximum memory limit is now 3.5GB, code fixed to better
    enforce the limit.
  - Mixer and VGA capture code fixed to signal error if the
    memory address exceeds the amount of system memory.
    The general design of DOSBox-X memory I/O means that if
    physical memory writes are made beyond system memory,
    DOSBox-X will write out of bounds and segfault.
  - DOSBox Integration device now offers the program inside
    to capture the VGA output, for automated testing.
  - DOSBox Integration device now offers reading emulator
    time (PIC_FullIndex()) and setting a watchdog timer
    that triggers an NMI unless reset. Intended for use
    with automated testing.
  - Debugger INTHAND command now works properly in protected
    mode.
  - DOSBox Integration Device now provides an interface for
    code within to listen to the mixer output (to hear
    itself) for automated testing purposes.
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation fixed not to run or compute
    voices and ramps if the DAC enable bit is not set.
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now offers a hack to ignore
    writes to the Active Channel register if the DAC is active
    and rendering audio (Ice Fever demoscene hack).
  - SDL drawn menus fixed not to interact or draw while 3Dfx
    emulation is using OpenGL, to prevent it from disturbing
    the OpenGL context for 3Dfx emulation.
  - NMI interrupt handling fixes to resolve instruction pointer
    corruption if NMI interrupt triggered while a CPU core is
    executing instructions (i.e. triggered by I/O handler).
  - DOSBox-X integration device now provides an interface to
    trigger IRQ and NMI signals.
  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)
    - Improve disk image mounting: cycle disks only for the
    drive being mounted.
    - FAT drive fixes and improvements. Identify floppy format,
    and support filesystems that use only part of the disk.
    Fixes Make Your Own Murder Party and Music/Pinball
    Construction Set.
    - Return correct error code for verify sectors function
    when an invalid drive is specified. Fixes Hugo Troll game
    installers.
    - Prefer ncurses above curses (on some systems, these are
    still different packages)
    - Give a warning at startup if dpi scaling is detected.
    - Show segment override on XLAT instruction.
    - Change scan3x to be LINE LINE DARK instead of LINE DARK
    DARK. This matches pictures of scanlines better and doubles
    the brightness as the old implementation was rather dark.
    - Make it possible to compile without PNG support.
    - Report when a -conf file can not be loaded.
    - When searching CD-ROM directory entries, strip trailing
    period of extension-less filenames after stripping file
    version number and separator. Fixes disc check in Air Power.
    - Add Unit Number and Bytes Per Sector fields for DPB
    entries. Fixes Air Power installer and Windows 3 Virtual
    Memory dialog.
    - Reset write ops after drawing text in EGA graphics modes,
    consistent with EGA/VGA BIOS. Fixes Fun School 3.
    - Make Allocation Info work for CD-ROM drives. Fixes Bureau
    13 installer.
    - Prevent double-loading of CD-ROM images.
    - Don't generate sound after DMA is masked at end of single
    cycle transfer. Prevents issues with some games.
    - Use right field when dealing with joysticks.
    - Check for both read-only modes when writing files to drive
    - Correct one-off error in paging table size compare for
    when not using USE_FULL_TLB
    - Make CMOS equipment list startup display mode bits differ
    from BIOS on EGA/VGA. Fixes Sauro.
    - Implement port 62h with timer 2 output for CGA and
    Hercules machine types; fixes Frank Bruno's Boxing and Math
    Maze.
    - Acknowledge mouse interrupt before entering user routine;
    fixes sound stutter during mouse movement in Eye of the
    Beholder III and Casino Tournament of Champions. Clear
    button counters in the mouse driver reset function;
    prevents unintended skipping of intro in MechWarrior and
    others.
    - Correct relative track length in subchannel data for
    CD-ROM images; fixes speech audio cutting off too soon in
    Casino Tournament of Champions.
    - Reset followed by switch to UART mode should take some
    time; fixes MPU detection in F29 Retaliator and Hover Force.
    - Ignore unrequested data in intelligent mode; fixes Roland
    sound in Krusty's Fun House.
    - Repair double slash in configfile location on Macs. Add
    some protection against a NULL dirp.
    - Fix loading of configfiles specified with -conf but
    present in the userdir with -userconf present.
    - Fix up DOS_Drive_Cache::GetShortName.
    - Change multi-remain to repeat last parsed value for
    non-string types if the next value is empty and of the same
    type as the last. Use this to add an optional parameter to
    sensitivity which controls the y axis. When optional
    parameter is missing, x and y axis have the same value.
    Change limits on sensitivity to allow for negative values
    so the Mouse Y-axis can be inversed.
    - Correct bug related to signedness.
    - Improve prefetch and simple cores to not switch to normal
    core on trap execution. Fixes the demo version of
    Prehistorik 2 and similar cases that use the trap flag and
    prefetch tricks.
    - Check lengths before adding C-style strings together.
    - Fix unmounting of complex drives where parts were left and
    file pointers were kept open.
    - Stop storing raw modrm value. Should save an instruction
    on each get_modrm call.
    - Strip leading = from value. Can happen if you execute
    "irq =5".
    - Don't remove bytes from autoexec.bat when changing
    settings from autoexec.bat, but replace them instead. This
    way the location stays valid.
    - Let dynamic core recompile interrupt instructions in
    non-debug builds. Can help software with many INTs, such as
    compiled BASIC, run faster.
    - Add logic in mouse driver to ignore button events that
    are out of sequence. Fixes International Rugby Challenge
    when clicking to lock the mouse.
    - Use a more compatible offset for DOS redirected interrupt
    vector. Works around a null pointer bug in the notes dropdown
    list of Jack the Ripper.
    - Reqrite pop_ev so it can trigger pagefaults again. Fixes
    Win 3.11.
    - Fix uninitialized access to some isoDrive fields. Pause audio
    before switching. Use right subunit with multiple CDs on one
    drive letter.
    - Move all stack alignment operations into one place and
    some optimalisations to RISC x64 dynamic core.
    - Merged in MAME sound from mainline, except for Tandy sound. 
0.82.19
  - Prefetch core fixed up, made more aggressive, and string
    instructions (REP MOVSW) cause more prefetch. "Stereotype"
    demoscene production can run again.
  - DOSBox Integration device now allows ISA DMA read/write
    injection.
  - 8237 DMA emulation now supports PC-98 "auto bank increment"
    functions, which automatically increments the DMA page number
    on DMA wraparound. Sim City 2000 needs this to play it's
    digitized sound effects properly.
  - 8237 DMA emulation now enforces read/write mode provided by
    guest. If the DMA is configured for reading from system
    memory, then attempts to WRITE to memory via DMA must fail.
    Just like real hardware.
  - 8237 DMA block transfer cleanup, de-duplication.
  - 8237 DMA block cleanup allows implementation of 8/16-bit DMA,
    forwards and backwards.
  - PC-98 keyboard corrections (not yet verified to be accurate
    to hardware though) to solve problems where holding a key
    while running a program that is slow to respond to input
    can overrun the buffer and fail to handle additional input.
  - VGA BIOS size changed to 0x4000 (16KB), because 0x3800
    is not liked by Windows 3.0.
  - Font vector is now INT 44h for PCjr and Tandy emulation,
    INT 43h otherwise as documented in the RBIL.
  - Graph key (PC-98 mode) no longer registers as keyboard
    input to INT 18h. EDIT.COM's menu is now usable.
  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=02h fixed to return the correct keyboard
    status byte as documented
  - Local directory filesystem support now applies timestamp
    before closing the file handle, which should help with
    timestamps even if the filename is not directly valid
    on the host operating system or filesystem.
  - DOSBox Integration Device moved to I/O port DB28h-DB2Bh
    in PC-98 mode to avoid conflicts with DMA controller
    registers.
  - DMA controller is now completely disabled in IBM PCjr mode
    (machine=pcjr) to match real hardware.
  - COPY command now copies file date/time as well.
  - INT 2Fh AX=1600h no longer logs an error as unimplemented.
    (Allofich)
  - COPY.EXE removed, so that the built-in COPY command can work.
  - PC98UTIL fixed to re-enable the text layer after the BIOS call
    for /24khz and /31khz options.
  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=30h now allows setting the 480-line mode.
  - (PC-98) Port 6Ah command 40h/41h, CRT vs Plasma/LCD mode,
    added.
  - PC98UTIL.COM now updates the menu item for PC-98 GDC clock
    speed when changing GDC clock speed.
  - Added to PC98UTIL.COM the /24khz and /31khz switches to change
    hsync rate.
  - Updated PC-98 graphics plane emulation to more properly
    handle the 5MHz GDC mode, and the IM bit in the GDC parameter
    RAM.
  - INT 18h AH=30h and AH=42h mode set fixed to update CPU and
    display pages correctly.
  - INT 18h AH=30h (PC-98 mode) now permits graphics layer changes.
  - INT 18h AH=30h (PC-98 mode) now permits changing hsync rate.
  - INT 18h AH=31h (PC-98 mode) now uses BIOS data area to
    return hsync rate (24KHz vs 31KHz)
  - INT 18h AH=42h (PC-98 mode) now uses BIOS data area to
    determine 5MHz GDC instead of internal state to better emulate
    actual hardware behavior.
  - PC-98 text console output now fills both cells of doublewide
    characters on the text layer.
  - PC-98 port 6Ah now handles command 82h/83h and 84h/85h which
    allow the guest to reprogram the GDC clock frequency (2.5MHz
    or 5MHz). This is necessary to handle strange Windows 3.1
    behavior where entering a DOS program fullscreen causes
    Windows 3.1 to reprogram your GDC to run at 5MHz regardless of
    the BIOS (or dosbox.conf) setting.
  - PC-98 port 68h now supports command 0Eh/0Fh to enable display.

    non-VGA machine types. Fixes Tandy and EGA display in
    International Hockey booter.
    - Handle "copy H*.txt file.txt" correctly
    - Fix detection of always_inline attribute with MinGW 4.9.2
    - Introduce mount -pr to mount paths relative to last
    loaded configuration file.
    - Use normal teletype function for non-ANSI output so the
    default attribute 7 applies only to graphics modes and
    existing attributes are not changed in text modes.
    - Improve compatibility of internal mouse driver with
    respect to video mode changes and hiding the pointer, and
    handle font reloading as a kind of mode change. Also fix
    unlocked mouse pointer to recognize the full range of
    tweaked/fontloaded text modes.
    - Bring OS2 port up to date.
    - Ignore/remove single % in batchfiles.
    (Fixes B13Demo batchfiles on PC Gamer cover disc 1995-08)

    fixes Romancing Prince.
    - Add some more cases to the Alt-Tab detection.
    - Add alternate font tables and associated loading logic

    characters (e.g. m,w,M,W,T,Z,0) in all VGA machine types.
    - Update all related BIOS memory values and CRTC registers
    when loading fonts.
    - Improve support for MDA emulation in the vgaonly machine
    type, as it is the only way the video BIOS can make use
    of the 14-line alternate symbols.
    - Be compatible by setting the INT 43h vector to the first
    half of the 8-line font table for standard text modes.
    - Move VESA mode table and OEM string before font tables
    in the video ROM, which is a more compatible ordering.
    - Add opl3gold option to oplmode setting. With this option
    the Adlib Gold music can be selected in Dune. Only music
    without effects is supported. FM volume control does work.
    - Add hardware text mode cursor support.
    - Rework FCB_ParseName
     -- Remove special code for . and .. as it was wrong
     -- Continue reading the input string, when the max length
     of the field has been reached (123456789.12345 is read and
     returned as 12345678.123)
     -- Strip spaces before and after reading the separators.
     -- The drive is always parsed (if present), it doesn't
     depend on the existence of said drive.
     -- Fix parsing of .EXE and other extension only names
     -- Always clear out current block and record size.
    - Correct AX and BX, they contain information on the
    existence of the drives specified in the FCBs in the
    execute block
    - Rework the parsing of arguments into the FCBs
    - Use full mask; fixes label search on FAT drives.
    - Don't write past the terminator in the DTA name field

    writing junk after the terminator was not good in any case.
    Fixes file listing in the 16-bit version of Galaxy Player.
    - Improve rename support for when renaming files (in a
    folder) on a drive different from the current one.
    - Improve internal ANSI support to adapt to currently
    displayed columns and rows. Fixes original Infocom
    interpreters when using something other than 80x25.
    - Handle double-quoted values and quoted values in
    dosbox.conf files.
    - Speed up GetHexValue.
    - Restore 1,2,3,4,5 as run 5,500,1000,5000,10000
    instructions.
    - Change BIOS equipment list to indicate DMA not
    supported on PCjr machine type, which fixes PCjr
    detection in old versions of Ancient Art of War.
    - Correct some offsets in the DTA for FCB-based search
    results. Fixes DIR listing in COMMAND.COM from MS-DOS
    and file info in XTree Gold.
    - Prevent a multiplication overflow and more accuracy
    by using floats for attack rate loop
    - Set record size to 128 if it is 0 in the FCB when
    calling any FCB read/write function
    - Fixes for acad 10:
      - Add missing reference counting when the file is
      already open when calling FCB_Open, so that acad, which
      uses FCBs and normal handles on the same file, works
      better.
      - Remove FCBs being added to the PSP filetable and
      rewrite most functions to support this change. This way
      acad won't run out of temporary (fcb) files when low on
      memory.
    - More flexible setting of version with "VER" command.
    - Fix screen clearing when setting mode 0xA on PCjr
    machine type.

    function.
    - Stop writing uninitialized junk into first shell's command
    tail at startup.
    - Support writing palette register data to dynamic save area
    if pointer is non-zero on mode changes. Fixes CV 2.2.
    - Be more compatible by converting tabs to spaces in the DOS
    console device rather than in the video BIOS teletype function.

    Prop_int
    - Implement an obscure behavior of the VGA DAC. Fixes wrong
    colors in Planet Soccer/Football.
    - Use default attribute behavior of ANSI.SYS in the console
    device. Fixes scrolling issues. Anything that wants non-ANSI
    behavior may not display as intended with the internal DOS,
    same as real DOS when ANSI.SYS is loaded.
    - Lower default adlib volume with 2.5dB, based on
    measurements
    - Add experimental name support to configmidi for coremidi
    - Add support for selectig midi devices by name to win32
    midi

    - Introduce a random sleep period, which activates after 3
    short sleeps in one frame.
    - Adjustments to cycle ratio computation.
    - Process repeated reset commands without delay. Fixes MPU
    detection in several games. Correct ACK for reset: entirely
    absent with dumb setting (mpu401=uart), and also absent when
    returning to intelligent mode from UART mode.
    - Allow for direct changing of 4op chaining without having
    to rewrite the algorithm mode.
    - Enable core inlining by default on configure/make build
    system
    - Limit amount of polls per second a bit on MAC OS X, as it
    was quite high otherwise.

    Powerdolls to detect harddrive.
    - Add ALSA MIDI 0xA0 and improve unhandled message
    reporting a bit.
    - Support rarely used FCB feature: open file with search
    mask. Fixes Buckaroo Banzai.
    - ANSI emulation is activated for the session when an
    escape sequence is encountered other than those used by
    internal messages. Fixes LucasArts setup programs provided
    that ANSI emulation is not activated.

    device count, and specific MBR/boot sector contents.
    Fixes (original) SimCity, Amberstar, and later MicroProse
    installers.
    - Fix GetLabel() for the virtual drive.
  - Integrated a commit from mainline:
     #3860 "Use PCJr specific method to clear the video RAM.
            Also don't scroll at unspecified video page.
            Fixes issues with KQ1 and KQ2."
  - PEGC emulation will now print a warning if the guest
    application or OS attempts to use 256-color planar mode.
  - PC-98 PEGC 256-color linear framebuffer is not mapped by
    default anymore, except when 256-color mode and the enable
    bit set, to match real hardware.
  - PC-98 PEGC 256-color emulation fixed not to respond to
    MMIO registers related to 256-color planar mode according
    to real hardware behavior. 256-color planar mode support
    is planned in the future.
  - Remove old dynamic x86 core. Dynamic core is exclusively
    dynrec now.

    but not currently selected, DMA channels. Fixes Visual
    Player 2 with SB16.
    - Minor cleanup to joystick code.
  - PSG noise channel emulation (PC-98 FM board) apparently
    broke on Mac OS X due to type promotion by Clang/LLVM.
    Modified the code to behave as originally intended, to
    restore the PSG noise channel on Mac OS X.
  - Added debugger command "DOS FNKEY" to view PC-98 scan code
    escape mapping.
  - PC-98 EGC ROP 9Ch added, apparently used by Windows 3.1
    CALC.EXE
  - PC-98 INT DCh CL=0Ch/CL=0Dh AX=01h through AX=28h added,
    which allows individual function/edit keys to be read or
    modified.
  - Dynrec dynamic core is now default even on 32-bit builds.
    Dynx86 dynamic core is still an option at this time if you
    compile from source.

    AX=FFh so that some programs (including SEDIT.EXE) can set,
    re-define, and restore the function key row.
  - PC-98 MS-DOS emulation now injects escape codes from a table
    for the function keys instead of hard-coded as it does on
    real MS-DOS.

    state.
  - Debugger data view now shows linear and physical memory address
    for the memory address you're viewing when the CPU is in
    protected mode. The physical memory address display is useful
    when 386 paging is enabled.
  - Debugger command "SM" now accept B: W: and D: prefixes to
    write BYTE, WORD, and DWORD values to memory.
  - Debugger command "SR" now accept multiple pairs of registers
    and values in one command.
  - Debugger commands "EV" and "SM" will no longer hang DOSBox-X
    on invalid (unrecognized) input.
  - Added "EV" debugger command to allow viewing CPU registers
    at the command line, including CPU registers not shown
    in one of the windows of the debugger UI.
  - Debugger will now explicitly tell you if it does not
    recognize the command.
  - Debugger fixed not to leave your command uppercased on the
    command line if it does not recognize it.
  - Debugger "SR" command updated to allow setting upper/lower
    halves of AX/BX/CX/DX, additional CPU flags and the whole
    flags register.
  - Added INP/OUTP commands to debugger to aid debugging

  - PC-98 planar emulation optimized and cleaned up.
  - Configuration GUI no longer crashes at startup if run
    from the command line using the --startui or --startgui
    command line options.
  - Configuration GUI fixed not to allow multiple instances
    of the same settings window.
  - Emulator speed controls added, if for any reason you'd
    want to play a game faster or slower.
  - Configuration GUI AUTOEXEC editor fixed so that
    "Append History" button actually works.
  - Fixed configuration GUI to show keyboard options instead
    of the mapper interface when you click the "Keyboard"
    button.
  - "Show details" menu option now also enables the realtime
    percentage display.
  - Mac OS X builds fixed to use older convertRectToScreen
    function instead of convertPointToScreen, which allows
    others to compile DOSBox-X on Mac OS X versions older than
    Mojave (despite Apple documentation claiming that
    convertPointToScreen was added in 10.12).
  - Shift and Alt key modifier handling within the configuration
    GUI now works properly in SDL2 builds.
  - Fixed prefetch queue emulation to allow 8086, 80186, and
    286 CPU types to run with prefetch queue without crashing.
  - CPU type selection menu will now cause guest to reboot
    if new cpu type is incompatible with the BIOS prologue
    and epilogue code that was generated at startup, to
    avoid crashes.
  - PC-98 NEC copyright string option now also installs
    another set of data in another location in the BIOS,
    that Windows 2.1 checks for.
  - Minimum MCB free value now has a higher default value in
    PC-98 mode to reflect the fact the platform usually has
    more loaded into lower memory at runtime. You are allowed
    to specify a lower value in dosbox.conf for anything that
    needs more memory.
  - GUS and Sound Blaster environment variable installation
    is now quiet, does not echo the variable on screen at
    startup.

    version of Windows 3.1 now displays properly without
    issues, except for line drawing.
  - Added INT 10h VESA BIOS function AH=08h "SET DAC WIDTH"
    so that, when enabled, DOS applications can switch the
    DAC from 6-bit to 8-bit.
  - Added basic 256-color mode emulation to PC-98 mode.
    Linear framebuffer, needed by PC-98 ports of DOOM and
    Wolfenstein 3D, is implemented. Bank switching, needed
    by a few PC-98 games, is implemented. 
  - MPU-401 emulation now accepts dosbox.conf option "mpubase"
    to control the base I/O port of the MPU-401 interface.
    The option can be set to "0" to tell DOSBox-X to pick the
    best default. Works in either IBM PC or NEC PC-98 mode.
    See dosbox-x.reference.conf for more details.
  - Fixed Sound Blaster 16 mixer IRQ/DMA select registers
    to work in PC-98 mode as they apparently do on real
    hardware.
  - Sound Blaster 16 and Adlib emulation now available in
    NEC PC-98 mode. I/O port mapping is based on a real
    SB16 card for PC-98 and some documentation. Only OPL3
    emulation is supported for Adlib. sbtype must be set
    to sb16.
  - NEC PC-98 emulation mode now emulates DMA controller.
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now allows game to read back
    the channel's Pan Pot register.
  - Sound Blaster 16 now implements 0xF9/0xFA fully, even if
    the RAM contents they expose are not fully implemented.
  - Sound Blaster DSP command E2h (DMA identification/test)
    code cleaned up and simplified.
0.82.17
  - Fixed yellowish tint of tv3x scaler on SDL1 builds of
    Mac OS X.
  - Fixed hq2x/hq3x and the various sai render scalers to
    render correctly on SDL1 builds of Mac OS X (where the
    odd BGRA color order is used). Prior to this fix the
    scaler output had a very strong yellow tint (missing
    or misrendered blue channel).
  - Fixed basic scaler template code to render correct RGBA
    colors in SDL1 builds for Mac OS X.
  - New grayscale scaler option, to emulate monochrome VGA
    monitors (frank-deng)
  - Menu handling cleanup from within Pause loop, including
    Mac OS X menu problems when invoking pause from the
    menu bar.
  - Shell welcome text fixed to show consistent first line in
    both IBM PC and PC-98 mode.
  - Pause mode fixed to handle mouse input while paused, so that
    SDL drawn menus (on Linux or HX DOS) continue to work while
    paused.
  - Added dosbox.conf option (off by default) to add the
    NEC PC-98 copyright string at E800:0DD8 for games and
    applications that require it.
  - Debugger can now show guest MS-DOS kernel MCB chain if you
    boot an MS-DOS floppy or hard disk image using
    BOOT --boothax msdos. For use with MS-DOS 3.3 or higher
    including the real mode MS-DOS environment of Windows 95.

    WARNING: Use boothax msdos ONLY with real mode MS-DOS, do
    not use with the protected mode environment (desktop) of
    Windows 95 especially a DOS VM within Windows. Use with
    MS-DOS and a DOS extender (DOS4GW, etc) should be OK.

  - Added "--boothax <mode>" option to BOOT command. At this
    time <mode> is limited to "msdos" to instruct the emulation
    to intercept specific INT 21h calls to locate the MS-DOS
    kernel's List of List and MCB chain structures for use with
    the debugger.
  - "TV" scaler updated to render dimmer alternate scanlines
    in CGA graphics modes (frank-deng)
  - Direct3D output no longer leaves DOS screen frozen when
    Direct3D device is "lost" (such as hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL
    to bring up the Windows C+A+D screen).
  - Page fault handling on by default now for dynamic core,
    DOS games and Windows 3.1 seem to handle it OK.
  - Page fault handling no longer use non-recursive page fault
    method with dynamic core, no matter what. It's too unreliable.
  - PC-98 mode now switches PIT Timer 2 clock gate ON by default
    to satisfy delay loops in Sunsoft "Photo Genic" and allow it
    to run. Note that PIT Timer 2 drives the baud rate clock of
    the RS-232C port.
  - IDE emulation bug fixed that prevented BIOS to IDE
    geometry translation when BIOS head count == 255. This
    fix also allows Windows 95 to use it's IDE driver with
    >= 4GB hard drives instead of running in MS-DOS compatibility
    mode.
  - Disk image support fixed to allow 4GB or larger hard disk
    images to work again.
  - FPU x86 core no longer calls E_Exit if the FPU stack
    overflows or underflows.
  - Updated build-debug scripts to accept "32" on the command
    line as a sign to compile 32-bit (i686) on a 64-bit (x86_64)
    system. You will need a multilib-capable GCC and 32-bit
    libraries installed on your system for this to work.
  - SDL2 OpenGL fixed color order issue
  - OpenGL is now supported in SDL2 builds.
  - Changed MPU-401 reset duration (DOSBox SVN).
0.82.16
  - SDL1 support fixed to gracefully handle a case where,
    under Windows XP, with a audio device that is not cycling
    any audio DMA, DOSBox-X can hang on shutdown.
  - SDL drawn menus now shift and adjust popup menu position
    to ensure the popup is entirely within the screen in cases
    where the window is too small. Redraw issues related to
    that (overlapping item and popup menus) have been fixed.
    Minimum window resolution has been reduced to 500x300,
    enough to permit EGA 640x350 displays without a black
    border.
  - Fixed INT 18h AH=13h not to automatically show the cursor
    (PC-98 fix), which fixes the visible blinking cursor
    problem during games.
  - VS2017 project files can now compile DOSBox-X to run on
    ARM versions of Windows RT (driver1998)
  - Local filesystem support fixed to sanitize DOS dates
    before applying them to files on the host filesystem
    so that invalid dates within DOSBox-X do not make invalid
    dates on the host filesystem.
  - VS2017 project files can now compile DOSBox-X to run on
    ARM64 versions of Windows 10 (driver1998)
  - Fixed FAT driver progamming mistake (inherited from
    DOSBox SVN) that used the Windows 95 "Created" date/time
    stamp rather than the original MS-DOS "Modified" date/time
    stamp field.
  - FAT driver now allows setting file date/time properly
    on create or INT 21h call to set date/time, and updates
    date/time on close after writing the file. Copy a file
    to a disk image should preserve the date, and new files
    created on the disk image should no longer have the
    date/time stamp Jan 1st, 1980 12:00:00 AM midnight.
  - Configuration GUI now allows user to exit dialog boxes
    and windows by hitting the ESC key.
  - Entering the mapper UI on Mac OS X will now hide all but
    the Host Key button on the touch bar. Entering the
    Configuration GUI will hide all buttons.
  - If DOSBox-X is run on a platform where the GUI provides
    a menu resource, bringing up the mapper will replace the
    main menu with a mapper-specific menu until you exit the
    mapper. Same for the configuration GUI.
  - Mapper now allows user to exit by hitting ESC key three
    times in a row.
  - Windows MinGW builds now properly support and enable the
    Direct3D output
  - Mac OS X builds now contain the correct version number in
    the application plist. Using the Finder's Information window
    on the compiled application bundle will now show correct
    version information.
  - SDL1 builds fixed to always compile with internal SDL_net
    library instead of public library on the system
  - Mac OS X SDL1 builds fixed to always clip the desktop
    dimensions against the available video modes provided
    by the system to avoid problems with the 1080i/1080p
    modes listed in the System Preferences dialog and older
    HDTV LCD TVs with lower than 1920x1080 native resolution.
  - "unmask keyboard on int 16 read" option is on by default,
    to allow DOSBox-X to keep the keyboard working with
    Windows 3.11 Windows for Workgroups.
  - Added multi-monitor support and detection for Mac OS X.
  - Fixed problem on multi-monitor Linux/X11 setups where going
    fullscreen on the primary monitor leaves the non-fullscreen
    window sticking out on the adjacent monitor.
  - Windows SDL1 builds fixed so that on multi-monitor setups,
    going fullscreen will fill the monitor the window is
    placed on.
  - Added support for multi-monitor and DPI determination for
    Microsoft Windows.
  - SDL1 and SDL2 builds now examine multi-monitor setups and
    so that they can go fullscreen properly on one monitor
    instead of going fullscreen across all monitors, in
    Linux/X11.
  - SDL1 OpenGL code fixed not to leave a blank space at the
    top of the screen when going fullscreen (if the menus are
    SDL drawn menus).
  - SDL1 library modified to center cursor properly no matter
    where on the overall desktop the fullscreen window exists.
  - Multi-monitor and fullscreen support added for Linux/X11
    versions of SDL1 DOSBox-X.
  - For non-x86 targets, or x86 targets where the user prefers
    not to use the x86 FPU core, code has been added to emulate
    the FPU instructions and registers using the "long double"
    data type for full 80-bit precision. This fixes 3D glitches
    in "Explora" though it still doesn't pass the Intel i387
    test program.
  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=04h: Added software delay to slow down some
    older PC-98 games that poll keyboard/mouse while animating
    cutscenes. The games seem to be timed around the assumption
    that this call has some delay to it. This fixes problems with
    "Shangrlia" by Elf corporation and animation that runs way
    too fast.
0.82.15
  - Incorporated x86 FPU emulation from DOSBox SVN to improve FPU
    precision at least on x86 and x86_64 targets.
  - PC-98 port 6Ah fixed not to allow setting EGC enable unless
    another EGC enable bit has been set, as specified in the PC-9801
    bible.
  - SVGA mode 0x10A (text mode) fixed to display properly instead
    of only the top half.
  - BIOS keyboard handling fixed in PC-98 mode so that Shift+Ro
    types an underscore as expected.
  - SVGA emulation (Tseng ET4000 and S3) fixed to reflect real
    hardware behavior where BYTE/WORD/DWORD VGA bits in the CRTC
    are ignored in SVGA modes.
  - Added "debug page flip" and "debug retrace poll" options to
    the menu.
  - Added "Swap Floppy" and "Swap CD" commands to the menu.
  - INT 2Eh (MS-DOS command interpreter interrupt) fixed so that
    the segment value of the interrupt vector matches the PSP
    segment of COMMAND.COM. Some DOS applications rely on that
    segment value as a starting point to enumerate the MCB
    chain.
  - PC speaker emulation fixed not to print "queue overrun"
    messages if the game or demo is attempting to use the PC
    speaker while pcspeaker=off. 
  - PC speaker emulation fixed to improve accuracy and to ensure
    the square wave is synchronized to the 8254 PIT output.
    This change appears to have improved sound quality with
    PWM "digitized speech" output.
  - 8254 emulation fixed to improve overall accuracy
  - 8254 PIT timer emulation fixed not to report writes to PIT 0
    Timer counters if the game is writing the same value
    repeatedly.
  - 8254 PIT timer connected to PC speaker now handles new counter
    value without causing full reset of the square wave (mode 3),
    which allows DOSBox-X to pass all tests in DOSLIB.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to control bus speed (and therefore
    I/O delay) of the C-BUS in PC-98 mode. Added defaults
    appropriate to PC-98 mode according to bus speeds documented
    for PC-98.
  - Timer clock gate emulation fixed to work properly in PC-98
    mode as well as IBM PC mode, when the PC speaker clock is
    enabled or disabled. This includes resetting the counter
    on the 8254 when the clock gate (trigger pin) is turned off
    [DOSLIB test TPCRAPI6.EXE]
  - Introductory text now indicates whether the build was
    compiled against SDL1 or SDL2 (emendelson)
  - Windows SDL1 builds now remember window position even when
    entering/leaving fullscreen mode.
  - "Restart DOSBox-X" menu and command code removed.
  - Linux/X11 window focus fixup. The change in 0.82.14 broke
    main window focus handling entirely by forgetting to check
    for the "window manager" window handle.
0.82.14
  - Windows builds, if run on Windows 7 or higher, will now direct
    the task bar preview to show only the part of the window
    containing the DOS screen.
  - SDL1 Mac OS X builds fixed to remember window position even
    if going to or from fullscreen mode.
  - Fixed mistakes with SDL2 surface output that caused serious
    UI problems with fullscreen mode and fullresolution=original.
  - Fixed problems with SDL1 Mac OS X and the window/dock menu
    filling up with multiple windows that have long ceased to
    exist.
  - SDL1 Mac OS X startup code replaced with startup code from
    SDL2 in order to run from main() cleanly instead of running
    SDL_main from an OS X event callback. This also fixes the
    problem of an unresponsive menu on startup if run from the
    terminal.
  - SDL1 Mac OS X builds fixed not to destroy and recreate the
    window every time it is resized.
  - SDL1 Mac OS X builds fixed to keep the window position
    stable every time you resize or do anything to trigger
    window recreation. Resizing the window no longer causes it
    to re-center to your screen.
  - SDL initializion fixed not to bail out on startup if
    DOSBox-X is unable to initialize SDL1 CD-ROM support (ccawley2011)
  - Segfault fixed (NULL pointer de-reference) that
    occurs when running DOSBox SVN on anything older than
    Mojave. DOSBox-X was not affected but the fix was applied
    just the same because the possibility is there.
  - Configuration GUI fixed to fade out with the right color
    RGBA order on Mac OS X.
  - Mac OS X SDL1 builds fixed to ignore mouse movement that
    occurs outside the window, unless any buttons are held
    down.
  - Mac OS X RGBA color order error with output=opengl fixed.
    EGA/CGA/MDA/Hercules/etc. modes should display properly
    now on OS X with OpenGL output.
  - SDL1 builds for Mac OS X now use the full Application
    menu generated by SDL1 instead of just an About command.
  - SDL1 builds under Mac OS X now support the "touch bar"
    on Macbook Pro and offer a few basic shortcuts,
    including a few that the touch bar makes much more
    inconvenient to use since the function key row is
    virtual on the touch bar instead of physical.
  - SDL1 builds under Mac OS X now offer a few basic
    DOSBox-X shortcuts if you command-click or double-tap
    the application icon in the dock.
  - Added support for taskbar extensions offered by
    Windows 7 and higher that allow DOSBox-X to put
    additional buttons in the preview pane that appears
    when you hover over DOSBox-X in the taskbar.
  - Centos 7 SDL1 builds (Linux X11) can now go fullscreen
    properly, instead of making the user input devices
    unusable running in an endless loop.
  - Windows builds now include Mapper and Configuration GUI
    commands in the system menu.
0.82.13
  - Mac OS X SDL2 builds now use the native OS X menu
    system instead of the "SDL drawn" menus.
  - Mac OS X SDL1 builds now default to the OpenGL
    output (if compiled with OpenGL support). Under
    recent versions of OS X, OpenGL output gives
    better performance than surface (CGBitmap) based
    display.
  - SDL2 builds now have working XBRZ scaler support.
  - Mac OS X SDL2 builds updated to completely ignore
    touch events, because SDL2 sees the touchpad on
    Macbooks as a touchscreen. Prior to this fix, the
    DOSBox-X UI was unusable due to mixed input events
    from both the touchpad and the mouse input from the
    touchpad.
  - SDL1 High DPI support for Mac OS X users with Retina
    displays.
  - SDL1 fix for display problems (blank windows) on Mac
    OS X 10.14.x (Mojave).
  - Windows builds (compiled with VS2017) now have working
    MT32 (Munt) emulation.
  - Adjusting CPU cycles with F12 + - / F12 + + (Increment
    and Decrement Cycles shortcuts) now updates cpu cycles
    property. This fixes a problem where adjusting the cycle
    count then changing the CPU core caused DOSBox-X to reset
    the cycle count back to the original value.
  - Linux/X11 support fixed not to assume XRandR extensions
    are present, but to instead ask the X11 server first.
  - Simple scaler rendering has altered the RENDER start line
    state so that detection of a changed line triggers a block
    of rendering without compare within a limited count before
    checking again. This means a reduced CPU load with scalers
    because it only detects frame changes every line before
    changes detected, and then on average every 12th line
    when running the scaler code. Hopefully this helps the
    Raspberry Pi keep up with DOS gaming better.
  - Simple scalers now offer compile-time (not run-time)
    option to omit per-pixel compare in scaler and process
    the entire scanline instead as a performance adjustment
    for slower and embedded systems.
  - Video debug menu added. First item is one that blanks the
    display to test screen updating.
  - Simple scalers (normal 2x-5x and SAI) revised to process
    changes and scaler rendering in larger blocks for possible
    performance improvement.
  - Simple scalers fixed to properly compare all pixels to
    detect changes properly, instead of only the first 4-8
    pixels.
  - EGA/VGA text rendering combined to reduce code copypasta
    and reduce bugs.
  - VGA 16-color planar modes now obey CRTC byte/word/dword
    bits.
0.82.12
  - MinGW HX DOS builds fixed to accept mouse input properly
    even beyond the 640x480 of the original SDL window
    dimensions. HX DOS seems to use the original dimensions
    of the window even if the window is maximized, thus the
    mouse input issue.
  - Configuration GUI fixed not to restore (unmaximize)
    the window, it's unnecessary.
  - New build scripts for Mac OS X, MinGW, and MinGW HX-DOS,
    under build-scripts in the source tree, to help make
    DOSBox-X releases more timely and consistent.
  - MinGW HX DOS builds now use WS_POPUP style instead
    of WS_OVERLAPPED to avoid window caption redraw
    glitches when in Windows XP.
  - MinGW HX DOS builds fixed to force the SDL window
    maximized at all times. Mapper and Configuration GUI
    interfaces fixed not to call on Windows to SW_RESTORE
    the window, in order to keep it maximized.
  - Steel Gun Nyan PIT/Timer hack revised so that polling
    the timer does not cause an interrupt storm. This
    fixes "God of Thunder" MS-DOS game where entering or
    leaving a house causes the Adlib music to play
    REALLY FAST during the transition effect.
  - Dynrec core ported from DOSBox SVN (Daniel-Trevitz)
  - Configuration GUI will pack settings closer together
    if the window/screen size is below 800x600.
  - Configuration GUI fixed to size dialog boxes as
    large as needed to show all options, to allow tabbing
    between options, to show a focus rectangle on the
    items.
  - Configuration GUI top level windows no longer show
    inactive title bar whenever you access a menu.
  - About dialog in configuration GUI updated to
    reflect that this is DOSBox-X in 2018, not
    DOSBox in 2014.
  - Configuration GUI now works with touchscreens in
    SDL2 builds.
  - INT 33h fixed to regard cursor as hidden if hidden
    for at least 100ms, which fixes host cursor flickering
    when running the built-in FreeDOS EDIT.COM program.
  - Mouse input and guest pointer integration limited
    to send input only if within the display region or
    within a 10% border around the display region.
  - SDL2 tapping the SDL drawn menu bar (on a touch
    screen) no longer triggers mouse click in the
    guest application (bugfix).
  - SDL2 Linux/X11 hack, added to compensate for bugs
    in SDL2 v2.0.5 regarding Linux/X11 touchscreen
    events, removed. SDL2 v2.0.9 fixed it.
  - Linux/X11 SDL2 builds will now encourage the user
    to update the SDL2 library installation if
    SDL2 library v2.0.5 is installed.
  - Fullscreen mode fixed in SDL2 builds.
  - Fixed configuration GUI fade out/in effect after
    exiting mapper GUI bug.
  - Configuration GUI now available and working in
    SDL2 builds as well as SDL1.
  - SDL2 builds now have a working "Fit aspect ratio"
    option.
  - SDL1 fullscreen mode fixed to use either the desktop
    size or the desired output size, and fallback to
    non-fullscreen on failure, to fix a segfault that
    would otherwise happen.
  - CONFIG -set sdl showmenu= now changes menu visibility.
  - CONFIG -set render scaler= fixed to apply changes
    to scaler and force setting, and update menu items,
    instead of ignoring it.
  - CONFIG -set render aspect= now keeps menu synchronized
    with setting.
0.82.11
  - SDL GUI fixed to make fade/sepia effect fit the
    actual display rectangle instead of filling the
    window.
  - PC-98 BIOS keyboard handling now returns capitals
    for A-Z if SHIFT xor CAPS LOCK is engaged.
  - PC-98 BIOS keyboard handling now uses modifier bits
    of keyboard bitmap to process scan codes, hackish
    IBM PC/AT data area status handling in PC-98 mode
    removed.
  - PC-98 BIOS keyboard emulation now maps numeric keypad
    to produce the correct keyboard input to the console
    and games. This fixes games that rely on the numeric
    keypad and the DOS console driver
  - Command line parsing fixed to add any BAT, COM, and
    EXE file references given at DOSBox-X's command line
    to the autoexec.bat file run at startup.
  - BOOT command bug fixed that made it impossible to
    specify both disk images and the --debug and --force
    options.
  - Debug output fixed to make it easier to break into
    the debugger even during a flood of debug output.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to enable/disable the
    PC-98 bus mouse interface
  - PC-98 boot disks with 128 bytes/sector boot sectors
    now load 4 sectors instead of 2. Seems to be
    required by some games.
  - INT 13h read/write functions fixed to refuse the
    command if the floppy disk has a sector size too
    large for the implementation (such as a PC-98
    disk image mounted in IBM PC mode with 1024 bytes
    per sector).
  - INT 13h AH=2 (read sector) updated to return disk
    change error on first read after disk change, to
    match real BIOS behavior.
  - Floppy emulation now tracks "disk change" signal.
  - PIC event handling fixed, IRQ breakpoints now stop
    at the beginning of the interrupt handler.
  - MPU-401 MIDI default IRQ is now IRQ 6 in PC-98 mode,
    to match factory default setting.
  - MPU-401 MIDI IRQ masked by default in PC-98.
  - PC-98 port BFDB implemented, which allows control
    of the mouse interrupt rate.
  - Eliminated mouse periodic interrupt hack, the mouse
    interrupt on PC-98 is periodic when enabled.
  - 256-byte/sector hard disk images fixed to ensure the
    proper boot drive identifier is presented for MS-DOS
    when booting a hard disk image.
  - Added IMGMOUNT -o partidx=N option. N is an integer
    value that indicates which partition to mount, counting
    up from zero. This allows mounting disk images that
    the FAT driver otherwise can't identify which partition
    to mount.
  - New general -o name=value option for IMGMOUNT, to pass
    various options to the FAT driver.
  - Update Metal Force mouse hack to become a more general
    "fire interrupt on Port C write" with a dosbox.conf
    option to enable. This fixes the requirement to move
    the mouse constantly for "Amaranth" when enabled.
  - Add to cascade interrupt hacks by offering an option
    to ignore the "in service" bit of the PIC for the
    cascade interrupt, while still tracking it for
    the DOS game or interrupt. Handy for PC-98 games
    that check the cascade "in service" bit before
    acting on the interrupt (IRQ 8-15).
  - DOS kernel fixed to limit it's private area and
    UMB region to avoid overlapping the PC-98 SOUND
    BIOS.
  - PC-98 SOUND BIOS dummy stub added for games that
    call into it.
  - Emulator hanging problem fixed when inputs are
    processed while running at a very low cycle count.
  - Added PC-98 LIO BIOS list and stub for games that
    require it.
  - Timer and PIC updated to emulate Mode 3 Square Wave
    output through the IRR register. Needed for Steel
    Gun Nyan.
  - PC-98 INT 18h fixed to reenable and process any
    keyboard data waiting when the DOS game or application
    calls INT 18h to read keyboard input. This fixes
    keyboard problems with Quarth.
  - PC-98 FDC BIOS emulation no longer reprograms the
    timer interrupt, but uses an alternate hack to
    avoid divide by zero fault with Ys II.
  - PC-98 GDC command to read back cursor position
    added.
  - PC-98 DOS CON device emulation now maintains ANSI
    attribute byte at 60:11D as documented.
  - BOOT now hides hardware cursor when booting a guest
    OS in PC-98 mode.
  - INT 1Dh vector now points at segment FD80 to satisfy
    some games that autodetect PC-98 vs other platforms.
  - INT 18h AH=42 implement display "bank" bit for games
    that need it.
  - PC-98 text scroll region implemented (I/O ports
    76h-7Ah even).
  - PC-98 CRTC mode set regarding 20/25-line mode fixed
    to update line height, text vertical position/height,
    and cursor shape.
  - PC-98 emulation of text height/vertical position
    registers 70h-74h even added.
  - PC-98 text hardware cursor fixed to cover both halves
    of doublewide characters if cursor positioned on left
    half, to match real hardware.
  - Fixed music/interrupt slowdown whenever I/O and INT 10h
    BIOS emulation is involved.
  - PC-98 minimal (non-functional at this time) printer
    port emulation added, as well as system configuration
    port.
  - PC-98 CG memory region fixed to match real hardware
    behavior, responding to A4000-A4FFF.
  - FAT filesystem driver now supports 2048 bytes per
    sector filesystems.
  - FAT filesystem driver logical/physical sector matching
    fixed to improve flexibility.
  - Fixed crash that occurs if you maximize the window
    and then adjust scalers to produce output that is
    larger than the maximized window.
  - INT 33h emulation now offers hiding the host cursor
    if the guest has provided an interrupt subroutine
    for the mouse driver to call, since it usually means
    the DOS game wishes to draw the cursor itself.
  - INT 33h emulation now offers hiding the host cursor
    if the guest is polling the cursor position, to
    better support guest/host integration with DOS games
    that draw their own cursor.
  - AUX and PS/2 emulation no longer allowed if machine
    type is PCjr.
  - PS/2 mouse emulation fixed to disable itself if the
    slave PIC needed for IRQ 12 is not present.
  - INT 33h pointer integration improved to support some
    additional DOS games, and to handle DeluxePaint II
    enhanced.
  - IMGMOUNT now supports NFD disk images.
  - DOSBox Integration Device now available for PC-98.
  - Added support for T98Next NHD hard disk images.
  - Added support for T98Next NFD R1 disk images.
  - Fixed crash with VGA BIOS allocation if video memory
    allows the full modelist to overflow the available
    ROM space.
  - SDL2 mapper redraw issue resolved.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to determine whether INT 10h
    VESA BIOS emulation points at the modelist in ROM or
    copies the modelist into the DOS application's info
    structure when asked.
0.82.10
  - PC-98 INT 1Bh floppy emulation now fakes success for
    calls to format track.
  - Initial keyboard pause fixed
  - PC-98 INT 1Bh floppy disk BIOS call now resets timer
    interval per call. This fixes Ys II after disk swap.
  - BIOS fixed to put normal "unhandled INT call" handler
    for INT 0-7 even in PC-98 mode to avoid confusion
    between game crashes and unknown INT calls.
  - VFD image support fixed to properly handle disk images
    where a sector is marked with fill byte 0xFF and the
    data field is 0xFFFFFFFF, which means the sector contents
    are all 0xFF.
  - DOSBox-X now supports T98 NFD disk images (R0).
  - BIOS data area now properly reports a high-resolution
    CRT display.
  - INT DCh AH=1 CL=10h added, which is apparently a print
    string function.
  - BIOS data area now reports 188+ user-definable CG slots,
    which makes GAJET happy.
  - FDI image support fixed to read the header instead of
    treating it as a plain disk image with 4096 of junk.
  - PC-98 character generator is now accessible through both
    I/O ports A1h-A9h and through memory-mapped I/O range
    A4000-A401F. This fixes missing text in Eve Burst Error.
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation will no longer log GUS reset
    writes in cases where the same value is being written
    repeatedly, to reduce log clutter. Some demoscene
    productions have music routines that trigger GUS reset
    repeatedly without changing the register.
  - Added "gus master volume" setting to deal with games or
    demoscene productions where the music is too loud and clipping.
  - Added "Pause with interrupts". When enabled, the CPU is directed
    into a CALLBACK_Idle() loop to halt the game's main
    logic while allowing interrupts to run. This is useful
    for recording the game or demo's music because most DOS
    games/demos run the music and sound effects from interrupt
    handlers instead of the main loop.
  - Audio/video capture fixed to render audio even if muted,
    instead of rendering garbage to the capture file when
    audio is muted.
  - Experimental Emscripten + Node target (not reliable yet).
  - Added option to control how unhandled IRQs are dealt with.
    One option, mask_isr, is derived from em-dosbox.
  - Code added to read the screen dimensions in Linux/X11,
    either through XRandR or through the base X11 API.
  - Code added to read and store the dimensions, size, and
    DPI (Dots per Inch) of the screen.
  - Fixed bug that enabled IBM style APM BIOS in PC-98 mode.
  - For PC-98 mode, PIC emulation by default (but controllable
    through dosbox.conf) now initializes the PIC at startup to
    return the ISR (interrupt in-service) register instead of
    the IRR (interrupt request) register. This fixes FM
    music problems with Blackbird by Vivian caused by a
    programming mistake in the FM interrupt handler.
  - PIC emulation now accepts a dosbox.conf option not to mark
    the cascade interrupt as in service, for troublesome games.
  - VESA BIOS emulation now supports a packed 16-color (4bpp)
    mode as seen on a Toshiba Libretto (Chips & Tech) system.
    The packed format is different than the normal planar 16-color
    SVGA modes seen on most systems.
  - INT 33h no longer reports relative mouse motion unless the
    user captures the cursor.
  - Fixed EGA 16-color display modes (M_EGA) to honor CGA and
    Hercules compatible mapping modes (bits 0 and 1 of the
    CRTC mode control) and limit memory display to 8KB or 16KB
    accordingly. This fixes the mode select screen in the game
    "Prehistorik 2".
  - Removed Sound Blaster goldplay mode + sample accurate mode
    warning, goldplay mode no longer has issues with sample
    accurate mode.
  - Mixer "sample accurate" mode fixed to work again.
  - Windows SDL1 builds fixed to work around Windows SDK-level API
    limitation that normally prevents Win32 applications from
    fully receiving WM_KEYDOWN events for the left/right shift
    keys independently. Left and right shift keys are now fully
    usable on Windows builds (i.e. for use with pinball games).
  - INSTALL.MD guide and test files (Aybe)
  - CONFIG -get now populates %CONFIG% environment variable with
    configuration setting (follow DOSBox SVN behavior)
0.82.9
  - "Always on top" mode is now available for Mac OS X builds.
  - PS/2 mouse emulation fixed not to send relative mouse motion
    unless mouse cursor is captured.
  - Shell no longer provides MEM.COM if machine=pc98 or cputype=8086.
    MEM.COM is not compatible with either case.
  - INT 10h emulation will now set the S3 LFB enable bit for VESA
    SVGA modes, unless machine=vesa_nolfb was specified.
  - VGA emulation revised to report possible known problems with
    Windows 3.1 with regard to LFB base address or memalias setting.
  - VGA emulation fixed to emit warning if memalias=24, for S3 LFB,
    if machine=svga_s3, to inform the user that the configuration is
    known to cause the Windows 3.x driver to crash.
  - VGA emulation will no longer report S3 linear framebuffer address
    unless machine=svga_s3. The LFB address doesn't matter for anything
    other than SVGA S3 emulation.
  - S3 emulation will now automatically disable PCI VGA emulation if
    constraints prevent DOSBox-X from setting a linear framebuffer
    address aligned to 32MB (as required for PCI emulation).
  - VGA emulation fixed to pick a more appropriate linear framebuffer
    (S3) address if memalias is set to a value below 32.
  - Added dosbox.conf option "pci vga" to control whether the VGA
    emulation appears as a PCI or ISA device.
  - ROM BIOS now forces reported RAM down to make room for BIOS
    alias at top of memory instead of throwing an E_Exit error.
  - Fixed Hercules emulation (and MDA) so that the Hercules palette
    is always enforced. This fixes a bug where switching to HGC
    graphics mode resulted in monochrome blue/black graphics instead
    of the intended white/green/amber color expected.
  - Added MDA emulation (machine=mda). It functions like
    machine=hercules minus the graphics mode and Hercules-specific
    extensions to the base MDA card.
  - DOSBox shell no longer accepts dosbox.conf settings as commands
    by default, unless enabled in dosbox.conf. Typing "cycles" will
    no longer show cycle count. The dosbox.conf setting allows the
    user to enable it again i.e. for compatibility with DOSBox SVN.
    This is to prevent dosbox.conf settings from polluting the
    available commands at the shell and conflicting with shell and
    executable names.
  - EGA emulaton fixed to obey Color Plane Enable register in
    16-color planar modes.
  - Fixed BIOS model byte to report PS/2 model 30 correctly when
    machine=mcga, to allow certain DOS games to detect MCGA that way.
  - CGA mode/color select registers are readable on MCGA, fix 3D8-3D9h
    to reflect that.
  - INT 10h fixed to properly allow/deny AH=10h, AH=11h, and AH=12h calls
    according to machine= type instead of mistakes that blocked too many
    calls.
  - CGA composite mode should not be available when machine=mcga.
  - Fixed INT 10h to report MCGA color display if machine=mcga.
  - MCGA (IBM PS/2 Multi-Color Graphics Adapter) emulation added.
  - bitop C++11 self-test disabled for Microsoft Visual Studio builds.
    Microsoft's compiler can't handle them for some reason.
  - Added DOSLIB DSXMENU.EXE to the built-in executable list.
    DSXMENU.EXE allows DOS CONFIG.SYS style menus to be set up to
    run commands based on menu selection.
  - PC-98 ANSI emulation fixed to use the number of rows on the screen,
    not cursor position, to range-clip ANSI cursor positioning.
  - Added code to have DX-CAPTURE wait 3 seconds (or until ENTER/SPACE
    is pressed) after the program exits, before stopping capture.
  - DOSBox-X menus now allow runtime selection of capture format
    (AVI+ZMBV or MPEG-TS H.264). Changing while capturing will stop/start
    capture correctly.
  - Added switches to DX-CAPTURE to allow specifying audio, multitrack audio,
    and video as well.
  - DX-CAPTURE shell command added. The command to run is specified
    after DX-CAPTURE and DX-CAPTURE will start video capture, run the
    program, then stop capture when the program exits.
  - VGA/SVGA emulation fixed to enforce 256KB (64KB planar) wraparound
    when emulating stock VGA modes (not SVGA/VESA BIOS). Some
    demoscene productions rely on the 256KB wraparound when showing
    scrolling credits.
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now uses I/O callout system, with
    I/O port handling to emulate ISA bus 10-bit decoding (but with
    consideration of GUS MAX 7xx registers) so that GUS I/O ports
    are visible every 1000h I/O ports. A demoscene production was
    found that relies on an alias of GUS ports at 5xxxh rather than
    using the I/O ports directly.
  - Mouse emulation no longer sends motion to serial and PC-98 mouse
    emulation unless mouse cursor has been captured.
  - Mouse emulation fixed to set sensitivity and mickey count even if
    int33=false on mouse emulation reset.
  - Debugger fixed to paginate commands with a lot of output, including
    HELP, PIC, and various commands to dump interrupts and GDT/IDT tables.
  - CPU core no longer triggers Double Fault if Divide Overflow
    occurs within Divide Overflow. This is needed for bizarre anti-debugger
    obfuscated code seen in a demoscene production, where the program
    wraps the demo in a mini-filesystem emulated by trapping INT 21h.
  - cputype= dosbox.conf setting fixed to allow selecting between
    new 486 emulation (cputype=486) and old 486 emulation (cputype=486old).
    The "old" 486 core emulates older 486 CPUs that differ significantly
    from the newer 486 CPUs that inherited features from the Pentium.
  - IRQ hack setting for GUS and Sound Blaster is now a list so that
    multiple hacks can be specified, but in a way that is backwards
    compatible with existing dosbox.conf files.
  - IRQ hack option for Gravis Ultrasound added.
  - INT 20h emulation fixed to work with demoscene productions that
    call INT 20h in a way that the interrupt frame wraps around the
    64KB limit of the stack.
  - XMS emulation now has a dosbox.conf setting to control the number
    of XMS handles available.
  - Added INT 33h option not to round mouse cursor coordinates to text
    cell boundaries in text mode. Some demoscene productions were found
    that detects mouse movement, but reads initial position from text mode
    before switching to graphics.
  - Removed IRQ0 error measurement hack, to match DOSBox SVN. This fixes
    timing problems with some demoscene productions. The error measurement
    hack was apparently added for Microsoft Flight simulator, but has not
    been needed since and has been causing timing issues since.
  - Fixed INT 10h VGA save state function to program the Attribute Controller
    properly so that the screen is not left blank after the call.
  - 8042 keyboard emulation now initializes port 60h to 0xAA on hardware
    reset and initialization. Some DOS games and demoscene productions
    need something with bit 7 set in the register at startup in order not
    to act as if a key was immediately pressed.
  - Add printer emulation from Daum's branch of DOSBox, add FreeType 2.9.1
    to go with it (Alex/AT)
  - Add keyboard type setting, for use in future development.
  - PCjr emulation fixed to emulate PC/XT style NMI mask at port A0h
    rather than emulate the secondary PIC.
  - Code of Conduct revised to make it clear that forks/derivatives CAN
    have their own Code of Conduct but that it only applies to that fork
    or derivative version. No forking DOSBox-X, changing the code of
    conduct, and enforcing it on anyone outside your fork.
  - CPU normal core fixed to clear ZF flag after MUL when cputype=8086,
    which fixes problems with MSD.EXE mis-detecting the CPU as a NEC V20.
  - Fixed PCjr emulation not to allow UMB (upper memory blocks) since
    that seems to cause stability issues with emulation. Also, PCjr
    does not have UMB as far as I know.
  - Fixed PCjr not to re-read port 60h from IRQ1 handler.
  - Fixed PCjr not to emulate INT 15h keyboard hook.
  - PCjr keyboard emulation fixed to trigger NMI and reflect to IRQ1
    the way it actually works on IBM PCjr systems, which also fixes
    keyboard control issues with the PCjr version of "Pitfall".
  - configure.ac now provides an option for compiler optimization (Yksoft1)
  - Code of Conduct, initial version, added to source tree
  - PC-98 palette save/load state
  - CPU, memory, VGA palette and attribute controller save/load state
  - DOS SHELL now implements INT 0x2E to allow DOS programs to invoke
    shell commands through COMMAND.COM (borrowed from DOSBox SVN).
  - Added dosbox.conf option to control the physical memory address of the
    S3 SVGA linear framebuffer.
  - Save/load state system added, currently very minimal and experimental.
  - Appveyor XML added to source tree (Allofich)
  - Fixed *most* SDL2 refresh problems.
  - Sound Blaster Pro mixer volume fixed to return reserved bits SET rather
    than CLEAR. Some demoscene productions detect Sound Blaster Pro by whether
    these bits remain set when written. This fix allows them to detect Sound
    Blaster Pro as Sound Blaster Pro.
  - VGA emulation fixed not to add 2 scanlines twice, which fixes VGA vertical
    timing and scanline count and fixes the scroller in "Inconexia".
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now prints a warning if the game/demo attempts
    a DMA transfer while leaving the DMA channel masked.
  - Fixed Gravis Ultrasound emulation to mask DRAM peek/poke I/O to the 1MB
    offered by the card, which fixes GUS problems with a demoscene production
    that has random values in DRAM address bits 23-20.
  - Added dosbox.conf option that, if set, lets Gravis Ultrasound emulation
    start a DMA transfer if the game/demo is polling the DMA control register
    when DMA is unmasked and DMA terminal count has not occured, which helps
    some demoscene productions.
  - Added "PIC unmask IRQ" option for Gravis Ultrasound emulation.
  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now has a dosbox.conf setting to initialize
    the hardware at startup as if ULTRINIT had been run.
  - Added dosbox.conf option for VESA BIOS emulation that, if set, instructs
    non-LFB modes to report 64KB windows but map 128KB from the start of
    the window, which helps (but does not fully solve) some Demoscene
    productions with redraw problems handling non-LFB as if LFB.
  - Fixed ET4000 emulation to support the hretrace "wobble" needed for
    "Copper"
  - VGA DAC/attribute controller behavior updated to reflect actual behavior
    as seen on an IBM PS/2 VGA model, as well as almost any SVGA clone.
  - VGA DAC behavior unique to Tseng ET4000 implemented when machine=svga_et4000.
    256-color mode on the ET4000 seems to map the low 4 bits through the
    attribute controller and, if enabled, the upper 4 bits through the
    color select register. Note this behavior is REQUIRED for the
    "copper" demo to display properly.
  - VGA palette, DAC, and attribute controller emulation updated to
    reflect actual VGA behavior, including the way that 256-color mode
    is mapped through the attribute controller.
  - Sierra highcolor DAC can now be enabled for any VGA/SVGA emulation
  - Cleanup and reorganization of scaler, aspect ratio handling (Alex/AT)
  - MinGW config.h builds fixed to enable Direct3D (Alex/AT)
  - Build fixes for SDL1 and Linux and extended functions (JP Cimalando)
  - Fixed ALSA MIDI mistake preventing the creation of subscription
    ports (JP Cimalando)
  - Previous release broke SVGA 16-color planar modes by masking video
    memory to 64KB planar boundaries at all times, fixed code to do so
    only for non-VESA modes. 1024x768 16-color mode works again.
  - Fixed user-defined VESA BIOS modes to validate the required video
    memory against the available memory on the emulated SVGA hardware.
  - VESA BIOS modelist generaton moved into it's own function. Modelist
    is regenerated upon editing/deletion of modes.
  - VESA BIOS modes added as suggested by hail-to-the-ryzen
  - VESA BIOS emulation now allows scriptable editing, deletion, and
    mode renaming of VESA BIOS modes for use with picky DOS games and
    demoscene productions that assume mode numbers.
  - Added VESA BIOS mode 0x136 as an alias for 320x200x16bpp mode
  - Enhancements to GFX_CaptureMouse and CaptureMouseNotify added
  - Fixed scaler change detection to use sizeof(int) properly than assume
    a certain byte count
  - Fixed undefined sse2_available reference issue in certain builds
0.82.8
  - New xBRZ scaler (with bilinear mode) (Alexat)
  - Fixed aspect ratio correction to use the ratio given by VGA emulation
    instead of assuming 4:3
  - output=surface and xBRZ now permit filling the window just like
    output=opengl and output=direct3d
  - Added critical section around Windows SDL 1.x resize code to solve
    the remaining 0.5% probability that resizing the window causes move
    and resize to stop working in Windows 10.
  - INT 10h AH=10h now ignores AL=3 in PCjr mode.
  - Fixed keyboard handler bug in PCjr mode that caused some CPU
    register corruption and general crashiness in games.
  - Improved shell: (Aybe, Joncampbell123)
    - Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right permits word-navigation.
    - Added emulation of 'Ins' key behavior.
  - Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock are now synchronized at startup
    and when DOSBox-X window gains focus again (Windows). (Aybe)
  - Added visual feedback to Hat/D-pad buttons in mapper. (Aybe)
  - Added documentation for 'dir' command sorting switches. (Aybe)
  - Menu 'Show console' is now checked with '-console' (SDL1). (Aybe)
  - Improved joystick support (see README.joystick): (Aybe)
    - Added deadzone and response for joystick axes.
    - Axes can be remapped for devices with questionable layout.
    - User-settable deadzones for joystick bindings in mapper,
      mappings like WSAD keys to axes is less frustrating.
  - Improved mouse integration (Aybe):
    - Now by default DOSBox-X does not emulate mouse movement when the mouse
      is not locked. This gives a consistent experience when compared to host OS.
      For the old behavior, use [sdl] mouse_emulation=always.
    - Added visual or auditive feedback about auto-lock state (Windows).
      This feature can be switched off, use [sdl] autolock_feedback=none.
  - Added CAPMOUSE program for capturing/releasing mouse from command line. (Aybe)
    
0.82.7
  - Mac OS X builds now honor showmenu=false by leaving the
    stock SDL menu in place at startup.
  - Default minimum MCB free/base is now 0x100, to sidestep
    unknown unstable DOS application behavior when DOS
    applications are loaded at around segment 0x800.
    This also puts DOSBox-X at parity with the base memory
    behavior of DOSBox SVN.
  - Add dosbox.conf option to set Sound BIOS enable
    bit in non-volatile RAM (PC-98) that tells older
    PC-98 games the FM card is present (Yksoft)
  - BOOT updated to boot D88 except for 2D format which
    is generally used by PC-88 disk images.
  - Added D88 disk image support
  - CMake files added (Aybe)
  - PIC timing updated to use "double" float type for
    more precision, but as a typedef for future support
    as a compile time option.
  - Removed geometry checks from INT 1Bh FDC functions,
    to allow non-uniform disks to work.
  - MinGW builds now allowed to use Direct3D.
  - Direct3D output fixed to use the same texture
    coordinate, window fitting, and positioning
    logic as OpenGL.
  - Update zlib and libpng libraries in-tree.
  - Fixed VFD disk image support to correctly signal
    failure to detect geometry, to avoid divide by
    zero crash with FAT driver.
  - showmenu= now taken into consideration whether to
    show the menu bar at startup
  - Fixed get_item() E_Exit crash if menus asked to
    show from dosbox.conf
  - SDL drawn menus fixed to integrate with Direct3D
    output on Windows.
  - PC-98 mode can now boot floppy disk images where the
    boot sector is 128 or 256 bytes/sector despite
    track 1 and higher having 1024 bytes/sector.
  - General codebase cleanup, compiler warning cleanup.
  - Enable XInput support on Windows (Aybe)
  - Fixed SDL drawn menus to use std::vector properly,
    not to hold onto iterators while resizing the vector
    and popping things off the top.
  - PC-98 INT 1Bh "read id" floppy disk call fixed to
    cycle through sector numbers. Some bootable PC-98
    games use "MEGDOS" which polls this BIOS call before
    attempting to read the disk. If the sector numbers
    never cycle, "MEGDOS" will not attempt to read the
    disk.
  - Fixed bug that prevented some menu options (such as
    "aspect ratio") from working if still in the BIOS or
    booted into a guest OS.
  - PC-98 mode fixed to ignore "mainline compatible mapping".
    That mapping mode refers to DOSBox SVN which never
    supported PC-98 mode anyway.
  - Fix PC-98 INT 1Bh "test read" call, which then allows
    "cherry bomb" to run.
  - Remove geometry checks in PC-98 INT 1Bh BIOS call, so
    that FDD images with odd sector sizes can work.
  - ROM BIOS now automatically occupies E8000-FFFFF instead
    of F0000-FFFFF when in PC-98 mode.
  - Most 128 byte/sector FDD images appear to jump to
    E800:0002. I'm guessing that's ROM BASIC, so add a
    callback at that location to catch these boot disks
    and show a message instead of allowing the boot
    sector to jump to nothing and crash.
  - PC-98 BOOT fixed to check for and support booting from
    FDD images where track 0 contains 128 byte/sector
    boot sectors.
  - PC-98 INT 1Bh support fixed to support reading/writing
    sector sizes other than the one sector size reported
    by the image. It is now possible to read the other
    sector sizes from an FDD/VFD image.
  - Fixed somewhat serious bug that, when compiled against
    Microsoft C++, causes the AVI writer to use the 32-bit
    lseek() function instead of the 64-bit lseek64() function.
    Prior to this fix, AVI captures would begin to corrupt
    themselves after growing past 2GB in size.
  - Cleanup code, fix compiler warnings, typecast problems,
    C/C++ conformance problems as reported by GCC 4.8,
    GCC 7.3.0 (MinGW), Visual Studio 2017, and Clang/LLVM
    on Mac OS X.
  - FM Towns machine type stub, for anyone interested in
    forking DOSBox-X to implement FM Towns emulation.
  - Code cleanup, refactor, according to compiler warnings.
  - SDL drawn menus fixed to copy Direct3D backbuffer to
    the SDL surface when popup occurs. This allows the
    menus to overlap the Direct3D display correctly.
  - Fixed Direct3D output so that when composing the next
    frame in the backbuffer, it also copies the SDL drawn
    menu from the SDL surface in order to keep it on
    screen.
  - Direct3D output updated to follow SDL clip rectangle
    struct, in the same exact manner as the OpenGL output.
    This also permits the Direct3D output to correctly size
    itself and leave space at the top for the SDL drawn
    menus.
  - Fixed dynamic core entry point to push/pop EBP because
    debug builds need the compiler to track the stack frame.
  - Updated in-tree zlib and libpng libraries to the latest
    provided by both projects.
  - Fixed VFD (FDD) disk image support to signal to FAT driver
    properly an error if it could not determine a geometry.
  - Fixed code breakage with SDL2 that prevented compilation
    with Munt (MT32) emulation enabled. SDL2 builds now allow
    MT32 emulation.
  - Mac OS X builds now compile against the in-tree zlib and
    libpng libraries for consistency.
  - MinGW builds now compile against the MinGW provided zlib
    and the in-tree libpng library for consistency.
  - Enabled MinGW builds to use Direct3D and Direct3D shaders.
  - Added code to auto-detect the VirtualBox display driver
    in Windows build, because OpenGL output doesn't work
    in Windows XP under VirtualBox. The change will switch
    the default output to "surface" if VirtualBox is detected,
    else will retain the "opengl" default. This change applies
    only to MinGW builds and not HX DOS or main VS2017 builds.
  - Added PC-98 INT DCh emulation for function call that
    writes a char to the screen, allowing Eve Burst Error
    to clear the function row
  - Added command line option to allow skipping the 1-second
    wait in the BIOS startup screen.
  - SDL2 builds now support use of the SDL drawn menu with
    a touchscreen device.
  - Fixed up SDL2 support code to compile correctly on
    Mac OS X.
  - Fixed up SDL2 compilation to automatically use the
    SDL2 library on the system, or if that is not available,
    use the SDL2 library in-tree. There are no plans to make
    modifications to the in-tree SDL2 code.
  - Added code to read and discard OpenGL error code before
    creating font texture, to avoid false failure handling.
    This fixes font rendering on Windows MinGW builds when
    output=opengl.
  - OpenGL SDL drawn menus fixed to ensure the menu contents
    have been redrawn at least twice. One for each OpenGL
    buffer because DOSBox-X uses the double-buffered mode.
  - SDL drawn menus implemented for output=opengl. The menu
    bar in Linux builds is now available in OpenGL mode.
  - SDL drawn menus fixed to redraw only when state changes,
    and to clean up menu drawing code.
  - US keyboards can now enter the "Ro" key in PC-98 mode.
    Default binding is set up to map the Windows Menu key
    as Ro in PC-98 mode.
  - VGA option change code fixed to trigger scaler redraw
    correctly. Changing video modes or changing between
    8/9-pixel VGA text no longer leaves artifacts on the
    screen.
  - Added code to force redrawing additional frames when
    output=opengl, in order to correct a bug with Linux/X11
    and MesaGL where the first OpenGL buffer swap after
    SDL_SetVideoMode() is misplaced when the window size
    changes.
  - Renderer SSE line comparison fixed to use correct sizeof()
    of the integer type during compare.
  - Renderer fixed not to use SSE and non-SSE line comparision
    at the same time, if SSE was enabled at compile time.
  - Fixed in-tree SDL 1.x library to allow DOSBox-X to disable
    auto-refresh of the window in Linux/X11 after SDL_SetVideoMode
    to prevent visible flickering when resizing the window.
  - Conditional support for Direct3D (9) output enabled for
    MinGW builds, if the MinGW headers are available (yksoft1).
    Option is disabled by default.
  - Configuration GUI dialog box widened to accomodate buttons
    that were previously cut off on the right.
  - Replace E_Exit() with LOG_MSG() for key codes from the mapper
    that a keyboard scan code generator does not recognize. This
    fixes E_Exit() crashes if typing certain keys on a Japanese
    keyboard with no equivalent in IBM PC/AT mode.
  - Added code to double the size of the menu and menu items if
    the window is 1280x800 or larger, for users with high
    definition laptop displays and screens.
  - Enforce minimum window size of 640x400 if the menu bar is
    visible and DOSBox-X is drawing them, to make sure the menus
    are accessible on screen.
  - Removed auto-scalar-size code when output=surface that was
    causing problems when resizing the window.
  - Do not show "screenshot" menu item if screenshot support not
    available at compile time.
  - Remove "always on top" for anything but Windows at this time.
  - Disable "Show debugger" option on Linux and Mac OS X if no
    console attached to STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR.
  - Disable "Show console" option on Linux and Mac OS X since
    the console is not under our control.
  - Windows "Always on top" fixed to remember selection and
    enforce it between SDL_SetVideoMode and fullscreen entry/exit.
  - Windows builds fixed NOT to change window Z-order on the
    screen when updating the window on SDL_SetVideoMode.
  - HX DOS builds fixed to keep window maximized at all times
    to fill the otherwise unused space on the screen since
    HXGUI only supports one window.
  - Menu framework support for any other platform (including
    Linux) added. The menus are drawn by DOSBox-X itself
    using the 8x16 VGA font. This also gives SDL 2.x builds
    a working menu. These menus are used if no other platform
    specific menus are available. These menus are NOT AVAILABLE
    at this time if output=opengl.
  - Cycle count edit dialog box fixed to immediately place
    keyboard focus in the text field, and to process
    ENTER and ESCAPE keyboard input as OK and CANCEL
    button input. You can type a new cycles count without
    having to click on the text field first.
  - Menu framework and mapper fixed so that menus always
    reflect the mapper binding in the menu.
  - Windows SDL 1.x fixed async hack to properly destroy
    and shut down the parent window again.
  - Fixed output=opengl crash on Mac OS X.
  - Menu framework support for Mac OS X NSMenu objects added.
    This gives DOSBox-X the same useful menu on Mac OS X
    instead of the useless default menu SDL 1.x offers.
  - Menu framework support for Windows win32 menu resources
    added. The Windows menu is now generated at runtime,
    the static IDR_MENU resource is no longer used.
  - New platform independent menu framework added. Menus
    that were once Windows-only are now available on
    any other platform including Linux and Mac OS X.
  - In-tree SDL 1.x library fixed to #define a special
    variable that the code now requires to compile
    SDL 1.x builds. The option to use your host SDL 2.x
    library is left open.
  - C++11 is now mandatory to compile DOSBox-X
0.82.6
  - Resizing the window in SDL 1.x Windows builds
    fixed to work correctly in the latest build
    (1803) of Windows 10. Prior to this fix, resizing
    the window on that build would quickly hit a deadlock
    that prevented the user from moving or resizing the
    window again after that point.
  - PC-98 dosbox.conf option added to select between
    accurate key/shift mapping, vs an alternate mapping
    appropriate for US keyboards (Yksoft1)
  - SDL 1.x for Linux/X11 modified to differentiate
    Ro and Yen keys despite X11 xkbmap apparently
    mapping both to the backslash. The keymap is
    queried to detect the scancodes at startup
    in order to return the correct SDLK constant.
  - SDL 1.x and DOSBox-X mapper code updated to
    correctly map Ro, Yen, @ ^ ; : keys on a JP
    keyboard in Windows and Linux.
  - PC-98 keyboard BIOS handling updated to generate
    ASCII codes according to PC-98 layout, instead
    of by US keyboard layout.
  - Mapper updated to support @ (at sign) key,
    ^ (caret) key, and a few other keys that
    exist on JP keyboards.
  - "Hold" modifier for mapper bindings fixed.
    It is now possible to tap the key again to
    release the hold.
  - VHD differencing disk support added (Shane32)
  - INT 18h AH=0Ah updated to support 20-line
    text mode. Some games use the 20-line text
    mode to space the text out vertically.
    Such games will display correctly now.
  - INT 18h now maintains text layer state
    in BIOS data area byte 0x53C, just as
    the actual BIOS does.
  - Added PC-98 INT 18h function AH=0Ah and
    AH=0Bh to support BIOS calls that enable
    "Simple Graphics" mode. This fixes
    problems with other games having vertical
    lines over the graphics, even though
    these games do not appear to use the
    simple graphics at all. (yksoft1)
  - Added support for PC-98 "Simple Graphics"
    mode of text layer attribute bit 4. When
    enabled, the attribute bit 4 changes
    meaning from vertical line to a bit
    indicating that the 8-bit character is
    a low resolution 2x4 bitmap to be
    displayed in the text layer. This fixes
    score and status display in Carat.
  - PC-98 INT 18h now implements AH=31h to
    report CRTC, text and graphics state and
    24khz/31khz video mode selection. This
    fix allows some games including Touhou
    Project to pace it's gameplay correctly
    in either video mode.
  - MinGW HX DOS builds default to host key
    F12 again
  - PC-98 mode now offers selection between
    24khz and 31khz video modes (yksoft1)
  - KEYB.COM fixed to load only the fonts the
    ROM BIOS has allocated. This fixes a guest
    system crash if using KEYB.COM with
    machine=ega
  - Moved host key to F11 for Windows. F12 is
    already taken by some internal debugging
    voodoo within Windows itself.
  - DOSBox-X codebase now strongly encourages
    compilation with C++11, will become
    required soon.
  - BOOT command fixed to make it possible to
    IMGMOUNT multiple floppies to drive 1, and
    boot from another disk in drive 0. This
    should enable the use of DOSBox-X with
    PC-98 games that expect to boot from drive
    A and the user to rotate through floppies
    in drive B.
  - IMGMOUNT fixed to support mounting with no
    filesystems and multiple disk images, and
    using the "swap floppy" command to rotate
    through them.
  - Added options to BOOT command that allows
    specifying multiple disk images and an option
    that says to swap disk images only through
    one drive.
  - VHD dynamic support added (shane32)
  - INT 10 AH=9 background color fixed in 256-color
    VGA modes.
  - Intro text updated to reflect new default
    key bindings.
  - Mapper shortcuts not in common use now exist
    without any default binding, and most existing
    default bindings are now associated with the
    "host" key.
  - Added 4th modifier "host" key to the mapper.
    This "host" key is F12 by default. The intent
    is to eventually move most mapper shortcuts
    to some combination of F12 and another key,
    rather than many shortcuts scattered over the
    keyboard. Existing dosbox mapper files should
    continue to work.
  - Renderer and 32bpp VGA display code fixed to
    reorder RGBA order for correct display on Intel
    Mac OS X systems. Mac OS X, on Intel systems,
    uses a strange BGRA 32bpp format that requires
    some adjustment on our part to display correctly.
  - Added more 24bpp INT 10h VESA BIOS modes.
  - Removed per-sector debug messages from VFD/FDD
    image support code.
0.82.5 (04/18/2018)
  - Expanded memory manager memory copy fixed to
    enable A20 gate temporarily so that the copy
    works correctly.
  - PC-98 FM board emulation now defaults to IRQ 12
    instead of IRQ 3. A lot of PC-98 games seem to
    have a strong preference for that IRQ with regard
    to FM music.
  - PC-98 reset I/O port (F0h) fixed to emulate CPU
    reset according to the SHUT0 and SHUT1 state set
    by the guest. Normally writing port F0h is a
    signal to reset but SHUT0 and SHUT1 can be set to
    indicate alternate behavior. This fixes VEMM486.EXE
    (an expanded memory manager) and allows it to run,
    since this manager appears to reset by port F0h
    then resume execution normally. Prior to this fix,
    booting a MS-DOS disk image that loads VEMM486.EXE
    at startup yielded nothing but an infinite reboot
    loop.
  - XMS and EMS emulation fixed not to leave A20 gate
    enabled unless EMS emulation is set to EMM386 and
    dosbox.conf is set to run the system in virtual
    8086 mode. There are plenty of DOS games that
    malfunction if loaded too low in memory with the
    A20 gate enabled.
  - PC-98 mouse emulation, at the 8255 level, now uses
    new C++ abstraction that seems to work fairly well
    even with the common PC-98 MOUSE.COM driver.
  - "BOOT" command in PC-98 mode updated to no longer
    require the --force switch. Booting MS-DOS from a
    hard disk or floppy disk image in PC-98 mode is
    generally functional now.
  - Added PC-98 SCSI/SASI hard disk emulation, and fixed
    BOOT to enable booting PC-98 MS-DOS from a hard drive
    (HDI image)
  - FAT driver fixed to read/write logical sectors vs
    actual drive sectors and removed geometry remapping
    hack.
  - FAT driver fixed to avoid memory corruption that
    may occur if reading a partition table from a drive
    that has more than 512 bytes/sector.
  - .BAT file parsing fixed to handle BAT files not
    in the current directory (yksoft1)
  - Fixed floppy controller emulation bug that failed
    to advance sectors during multi-sector read/write.
  - Fixed floppy emulation bug that prevented seeking.
    The "head" would get stuck at track 0 and never move.
  - Dynamic core allows running with paging enabled again,
    IF dosbox.conf says to allow it (yksoft1)
  - DOS file I/O functions AH=3Fh and AH=40h updated to
    reflect undocumented MS-DOS behavior that silently
    truncates read/written byte count if the offset
    and byte count reach beyond the end of a 64KB segment.
    This fixes some demoscene productions that read 64KB-1
    bytes but apparently rely on this behavior to avoid
    display errors.
  - FluidSynth fixes and API updates. DOSBox-X no longer
    uses a private API within FluidSynth. (heftig)
  - Added dosbox.conf option to control the size of the
    DOS "Swappable Data Area" which is said to help with
    shelling and task swapping in WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x
  - Added "minimum mcb free", and set minimum mcb segment to
    value same or similar to DOSBox SVN. The "free" option
    directs DOSBox-X to allocate memory before that segment
    value to fill memory.
  - Fixed COMMAND.COM PSP segment to correctly identify it's
    resident size in memory.
  - COMMAND.COM in the DOSBox shell now allocates itself
    normally instead of from a special segment so that it
    appears normally in the MCB allocation chain.
  - BIOS now clears it's stack before booting the DOS shell.
  - Fix Pause (CTRL+Pause or ALT+Pause) to release all keys
    in the mapper so that CTRL, ALT, or Shift are not left
    "stuck" when emulation resumes.
  - Initial host keyboard recognition, and base framework
    for general keyboard language/layout handling. Keyboard
    layout recognition added for Windows and Linux/X11.
  - Fixed 350-line INT 10h VESA modes not to apply EGA mode
    adjustments, which fixes display distortion.
  - INT 10h VESA modes 720x480 and 848x480 fixed.
  - Fixed INT 10h VESA emulation to round up bytes/scanline
    so that 4bpp planar modes display properly.
  - Fixed INT 10h VESA mode 1400x1050 16-color (4bpp planar)
    mode to resolve overlapping mode number.
  - Pulled in VGA vtotal + 2 fix from DOSBox SVN
  - Pulled in EGA display mode fixes from DOSBox SVN to fix
    EGA graphics emulation.
  - Fixed INT 10h AH=1Ch (save/restore VGA state) to handle
    VGA attribute controller properly so that the display is
    not left blank.
  - PC-98 GDC emulation fixed to handle START DISPLAY properly
    by un-blanking the display (fixes "Ellena")
  - Fixed possible format string vulnerabilities (gnustomp)
  - Added menu options to enable/disable EGC and GRCG
    emulation (yksoft1)
  - Added options to enable/disable EGC and GRCG emulation
    (to emulate older hardware).
  - Added PC-98 BIOS function to read 8x16 character bitmaps,
    which fixes "Power Dolls 2"
  - BIOS now reports 16-color and EGC graphics. Some games
    that check the BIOS for capabilities may now begin to
    use 16-color graphics and EGC functions.
  - Added PC-98 INT 18h function to read character font.
    This also resolves garbled text in TH01.
  - PC-98 GDC emulation now uses cursor specification
    (line per character row) to determine whether graphics
    are doubled vertically or not. Several PC-98 games
    switch between 200-line (doubled) and 400-line graphics
    by programming the GDC directly, rather than through
    the BIOS.
  - Added various video-related BIOS variables to the data
    in PC-98 mode.
  - GDC RESET/SYNC debug text updated to indicate which GDC
    is undergoing the RESET/SYNC.
  - Debugger "LOG" command (CPU execution logging) fixed to
    automatically stop logging when the BIOS begins the
    POST routine after system reset. The user who invoked
    "LOG" probably cares more about what happened up to the
    game crash, fault and reset rather than normal BIOS startup.
  - BIOS now properly unmasks the PC-98 cascade IRQ, which
    allows IRQ 8-15 to function, including the mouse (IRQ13)
  - Debugger interface now indicates whether 80386 paging is
    enabled or not at any time.
  - Help text updates to reflect DOSBox-X changes (Shane32)
  - BIOS INT 13h emulation updated to support up to 4 hard
    drives (Shane32)
  - IMGMOUNT and BOOT code cleanup (Shane32)
  - IMGMOUNT RAM drive support: Additional fixes and geometry
    work done, and some hangs resolved (Shane32)
  - CPU emulation fixed to allow setting a breakpoint on
    ANY interrupt of a specific number, not just software
    interrupts. It is now possible to use BPINT to break
    upon hardware (IRQ) interrupts.
  - DOS kernel fixed to drop to the debugger if the MCB
    (memory control block) chain is corrupted, so that
    the corrupted state can be examined. When the debugger
    continues execution, a full restart of the DOS kernel
    is run. If DOSBox-X was compiled without the debugger,
    then the normal E_Exit() path is still taken.
  - Added debugger command to show, and modify, the state
    of the PIC (interrupt controller).
  - Added debugger command to view or change the A20 gate.
  - Added debugger command to view the state of EMS, memory
    handles, allocation, and EMS page frame mapping.
  - Added debugger command to view the state of XMS, memory
    handles, and allocation.
  - Added debugger command to view the layout of the ROM
    BIOS region (0xF0000-0xFFFFF) chosen by emulation.
  - DOS kernel now logs kernel allocations, which can be
    seen in the debugger using the "DOS KERN" command.
  - Added "RUN" command as an alternative to hitting F5.
  - Added "RUNWATCH" to the debugger, so that watching the
    system run in the debugger is possible.
  - Debugger data window can now be used to view memory in
    segmented, virtual (through paging), and physical (bus
    address) modes.
  - Debugger window data and code view windows now indicate
    regions of memory that are beyond the end of the segment.
  - Debugger window data and code view windows now indicate
    regions of memory that are paged out (will cause a page
    fault if accessed)
  - PC-98 A20 gate I/O port F6h fixed to work properly as an
    enable or disable, rather than just an enable. The PC-98
    version of HIMEM.SYS no longer complains about not being
    able to control the A20 gate.
  - IMGMOUNT RAM drive support: Ramdrive bug fixes and changed
    drive limits from ATA limits to BIOS/MBR (Shane32)
  - INT 21h fixed to use BIOS INT 1Ch to read date and time in
    PC-98 mode. Arrowgun now runs properly.
  - Fixed EMS emulation not to claim XMS memory (and zero BIOS
    extended memory size) if EMS emulation is in EMS board mode
    (and therefore not allocating extended memory through HIMEM.SYS).
  - PC-98 INT 1Fh extended memory copy implemented. DOS games in
    PC-98 mode can now use this API to access extended memory.
  - Fixed HIMEM.SYS emulation in PC-98 mode to zero BIOS extended
    memory values when claiming extended memory.
  - PC-98 mode now sets BIOS data area values correctly regarding
    conventional and extended memory.
  - Added rudimentary emulation of non-volatile RAM at the
    trailing edge of text RAM (A3FE0-A3FFF).
  - PC-98 mode now adds additional BIOS data values at boot time
    so that guest OSes like PC-98 MS-DOS can see the floppy drive,
    see keyboard input, and determine the boot drive properly.
    It is now possible to boot MS-DOS in PC-98 mode.
  - Added rudimentary PC-98 INT 1Bh BIOS interrupt, at least for
    floppy disk emulation.
  - Cleanup and formatting enhancements to IMGMOUNT ramdisk (Shane32)
  - DOS CON emulation in PC-98 mode now emulates two additional
    ANSI escapes to clear the screen that are specific to NEC's
    MS-DOS implementation, which fixes text layer problems with
    Rusty.
  - PC-98 GDC dip switch 2-8 emulation fixed. It was backwards.
    This may break existing dosbox.conf configurations, apologies
    in advance.
  - Added -xms option to LOADFIX command. When given, the command
    consumes extended memory instead of conventional memory.
  - HIMEM.SYS emulation fixed to behave more like Microsoft's
    HIMEM.SYS implementation regarding global & local A20 gate
    control.
  - Mac OS X builds fixed to work from the user's home directory
    if run from the Finder, instead of trying to operate at the
    root of the filesystem as directed by the Finder.
  - Mac OS X builds now put the FREECG98.BMP file inside of the
    .app bundle, and fall back to it if not found in the current
    directory.
  - RPM builds now install FREECG98.BMP in /usr/share/dosbox-x
    and refer to it if not in your local directory, in order to
    better provide PC-98 emulation.
  - PC-98 BOOT command: Loading addresses and CPU register layout
    updated to match actual hardware behavior, in which the boot
    sector is loaded at just under 128KB.
  - Build updates to support compiling for Windows with MinGW.
  - BOOT now accepts a --debug switch that causes DOSBox-X to break into
    the debugger when the boot sector begins to execute.
  - BOOT now accepts a --force switch to override the PC-98 lockout,
    if the user wants to better understand why I locked it out in PC-98 mode.
  - PC-98 support now supports reading font from FONT.ROM, if available.
  - Code, data, and output now respond to arrow, page up/down and
    home/end keys as a user would normally expect.
  - Arrow and page up/down keyboard input now goes to active window
    instead of mapping directly to any specific window.
  - Debugger interface now has the concept of an "active" window, and
    the title bar of each window hilights if it is active.
  - Debugger interface now hides the "variables" window by default.
  - Fixed window "titles" in debugger interface to fill the terminal
    line they're on and use ncurses horizontal line character which
    on modern systems looks better than hyphens.
  - Removed one line padding around data window in debugger interface.
  - Debugger interface redesigned to permit more flexible layout
  - Debugger interface no longer crashes when terminal window is sized
    down too small (when there is no room for the output window)
  - EMM386 (ems) emulation fixed to always turn on the A20 gate when
    the DOS application requests to map pages into the EMS page frame.
    This fixes crashes with Creative's Sound Blaster 16 installer when
    run with the A20 gate turned off.
0.82.4 (02/28/2018)
  - Updated ramdisk formatting code to better match FAT12/FAT16
    specifications and limits (Shane32)
  - Menu items related to Gravis Ultrasound, Glide emulation, Innova SID,
    and other IBM PC-specific options are now grayed out in PC-98 mode.
  - Updated Windows menus to gray out CPU core and type options that
    are invalid. Selecting a prefetch CPU type while core dynamic is
    no longer possible, and selecting dynamic core while using a
    prefetch cpu type is no longer possible.
  - CPU type submenu in Windows updated to reflect all types supported
    by DOSBox-X including 8086 and 286 cores.
  - Fixed E_Exit() crash on Windows in PDCurses endwin() that only
    happens if you had never brought up the debugger console window.
  - Minor oddities with OPNA stereo panning resolved.
  - Sound Blaster, Adlib, and PC-98 FM emulation now reset state
    correctly when the reset signal is given to avoid stuck notes.
  - Fixed BIOS logo in PC-98 mode to properly reset the graphics mode
    so that the logo is visible.
  - Added Windows menu items to control PC-98 GDC speed, 4-partition enable,
    200-line "scanline" effect enable, and PIT timer clock control.
  - Added "Restart DOS" command to the Windows menu, with code to
    allow it only if at the initial DOS shell.
  - Added "multi-track WAV" command to the Windows menu, under Capture
  - Added "reset system" command to the Windows menu
  - "Restart" menu command updated to clarify that it restarts DOSBox-X entirely.
  - OpenGL HQ output removed.
  - Commands to force driver (DirectX or WINDIB) removed.
  - Default disk I/O limit raised to more reasonable speeds.
  - FM code borrowed from Neko Project II now compiles on Mac OS X
  - IMGMOUNT now supports mounting a RAM drive (using -t ram) (Shane32)
  - Direct3D fullscreen aspect ratio fixes, especially for
    monitors with a 5:4 aspect ratio (such as 1280x1024) (Shane32)
  - "Show menu" in Windows builds system menu is now a toggle
    to show/hide the menu bar (Shane32)
  - Fixed broken color palette with CGA composite and EGA
    machine emulation. Composite CGA and machine=ega displays
    properly again.
  - According to documentation, IBM PC and PC-98 use different
    initial PC speaker frequencies. Update the code to match.
  - 8254 I/O port alias at 3FD9h-3FDFh added, which is needed
    for several PC-98 games that program the PC speaker
    frequency through those ports instead of through 71h-77h
  - New Intel 8255 emulation. PC-98 system 8255 emulation
    now uses this emulation, along with PC speaker emulation.
  - Fixed XMS memory copy functions to enable the A20
    gate so extended memory copies work correctly whether
    or not the DOS application in question made the call
    with A20 enabled. This fixes crashes and memory
    corruption while installing Windows 3.1 using SETUP.EXE.
  - "CLS" now sends the proper ANSI escapes to clear the
    console in PC-98 mode.
  - BIOS logo in PC-98 fixed to clear graphics RAM and
    set graphics back to 8-color digital mode when booting
    to DOS. This should fix palette errors and color issues
    with older PC-98/PC-88 games that use the 8-color
    graphics modes.
  - Added PC-98 INT 1Ch timer interval BIOS function,
    and timer countdown routine in IRQ 0.
  - Windows builds now incorporate pdcurses and enable
    the debugger interface (bulletshot60)
  - DOSBox-X now tracks the systemwide keyboard layout
    on Windows, and acts on user changes to the keyboard
    and language in the system.
  - Removed hack code in SDL 1.x that sets DOSBox-X's
    keyboard layout to the US layout even if the host
    uses anything else.
  - Fix CPU cycles count increment not to nag you to use
    core=dynamic if a) dynamic core is not available or
    b) you're already using dynamic core.
  - Added dynamic core back, it seems to be very stable
    again.
  - PC-98 FM board now allows changing the base I/O port
    and IRQ (interrupt) line used by the card.
  - PC-98 mode now supports joystick emulation. Joystick
    input is mapped through the DOSBox mapper to the
    PC-98 FM board where DOS games expect to see it.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to select which PC-98 FM
    board to emulate.
  - Fixed PC-98 FM code to enable the ADPCM and Rhythm
    FM channels.
  - Re-ported Neko Project II FM board emulation, this
    time keeping the code intact and keeping the separate
    board emulations intact for PC-98 mode.
  - VGA palette errors with Crystal Dream II fixed.
  - PC-98 FM synthesis fixed not to initialize itself
    again when rebooting, which fixes a problem with
    garbled FM synthesis after rebooting.
  - Removed some now-unnecessary SDL Video quit/init
    calls from Windows builds.
  - machine=pc98 now starts entire emulation in PC-98
    mode instead of booting up in IBM PC mode and
    switching to PC-98 mode.
  - Initial "BIOS" startup screen now operates in
    PC-98 mode when machine=pc98.
  - Prefetch core debug code now disabled at compile
    time. Seems to be stable so far.
  - Prefetch core now emulates partial load of the
    prefetch buffer on miss, and completing the buffer
    fill on hit, to better emulate (probable) 80486
    behavior.
  - 486_prefetch is now a valid cputype setting, despite
    the setting having existed for years in the source
    code. Prior to this fix, 486_prefetch was ignored.
0.82.3 (02/13/2018)
  - Removed DOSBox SVN-style "fast" A20 gate emulation.
    Recent changes make it infeasible to keep. "fast" is
    now mapped to "mask" mode.
  - RAM aliasing is now always on, even if memalias is not
    set, in order to help enforce A20 gate behavior, and
    to fix emulator crashes when a non-aliased RAM page
    is referenced through an alias.
  - Cleanup and rewrite of prefetch core, to make the code
    cleaner and more readable and maintainable.
  - DOS file I/O updated to apply a proper delay rather
    than the old DOSBox SVN code's cycle count dependent
    method. The delay by default will slow disk I/O down
    to mid 1990's IDE PIO speeds, which can resolve issues
    with MS-DOS demoscene or game executables that can
    malfunction when disk I/O is too fast.
  - PIC code updated to enforce a proper IRQ delay on ALL
    IRQ signals, which fixes issues with MS-DOS executables
    that have race conditions between their code and their
    interrupt handlers.
  - DOS Shell now shows the full intro text only at first
    run, instead of every shell invocation.
  - Use FCB record size of 128 bytes if the FCB record size
    is zero (from DOSBox SVN).
  - PC speaker fix not to generate a continuous tone if
    the PIT timer was set to mode 0. This fixes issues with
    many early 1990s demoscene executables leaving the PC
    speaker enabled (BEEEEEEP).
  - Register DEBUGBOX.COM at DOS environment start instead
    of boot, which allows the command to work again.
  - EXE loader sets stack pointer (SS:SP) into PSP segment
    (from DOSBox SVN)
  - EXE loader fixed to use the larger of the minimum and
    maximum memory sizes listed in the EXE header, which
    fixes some demoscene executables with a minimum size
    larger than maximum.
  - VGA DAC (palette) emulation updated to better match
    actual SVGA chipset (Paradise SVGA) behavior, which
    fixes some VGA palette errors in some demoscene
    productions.
  - Added -nocachedir option to internal MOUNT command, to
    disable directory caching for a local folder mounted
    to a drive letter. When mounted this way, changes on
    the host filesystem are immediately visible in the
    guest DOS environment.
  - Added -ro and -rw options to internal MOUNT command, to
    allow mounting local folders to a drive letter as a
    read-only volume.
  - MIDI Fluidsynth fixed to initialize and free state properly
    so that switching to and from Fluidsynth doesn't cause
    a segfault or crash.
  - MPU-401 fixed to allow changes to MIDI configuration from
    CONFIG.COM.
  - DOS filename handling fixed to maintain ASCII conversion
    to uppercase, while not converting Shift-JIS double-byte
    characters in PC-98 mode. This fixes Shift-JIS filename
    corruption when the trailing byte can be mistaken for
    lowercase ASCII a to z.
  - Windows fixes to keep menu bar items updated with
    DOSBox-X state.
  - Remove WM_DROPFILES handling, for now. The code remains
    to allow re-enabling later.
  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to process only WM_COMMAND (menu
    bar) and WM_SYSCOMMAND (system menu) events so that
    the general chatter in modern Windows system does not
    drown out the messages. This fixes issues where the
    menu bar doesn't work on some systems.
  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to handle menu bar input using
    SDL's WM events instead of fighting with SDL's message
    pump to receive menu events. This fixes potential
    issues with losing menu bar events.
  - dosbox.conf reference included with Windows builds
    now uses MS-DOS line endings so that the file can be
    edited in NOTEPAD.EXE
  - New dosbox.conf option to control whether the menu is
    shown by default in Windows builds.
  - titlebar= SDL dosbox.conf option, to allow showing a more
    user friendly name for the program instead of just using
    the EXE name.
  - E_Exit() on Windows now displays the message using
    MessageBox() in addition to sending to STDERR, so that
    Windows users see the error even if they are running
    it from the desktop instead of the command line.
  - PC-98 EGC bit shifter emulation fixed to correctly support
    ascending and descending bit shifting in either direction.
    This fixes screen shake emulation errors with Touhou Project
    TH04 and TH05.
  - Linux/X11 fixes to SDL 1.x to better match and compare
    Visuals (descriptions of the screen) since X11 libraries
    don't seem to use the same pointer values for the same
    Visuals.
  - ALT+TAB or loss of focus from fullscreen in Windows now
    restores the window instead of minimizing it.
  - 3Dfx OpenGL will hide the minimize and maximize buttons
    in Windows while active.
  - Windows menu bar items are now grayed out when 3Dfx OpenGL
    emulation is active (items that cannot be used at that time).
  - Fix Windows system menu to always keep "show menu".
  - GFX rendering fixed not to render any output while 3Dfx
    OpenGL emulation is active.
  - 3Dfx OpenGL bug fixes to properly restore the DOS console
    when the 3Dfx card is de-initialized and the game returns
    to the DOS prompt.
  - Linux/X11 window output fixed to keep the window on the
    screen even when switching between OpenGL and non-OpenGL,
    and when setting the SDL video mode.
  - Remove some init hacks and SDL forced reinitialized hacks,
    so that the window is stable on the screen.
  - Added code to do more OpenGL state initialization (both
    output=opengl and when initializing 3Dfx OpenGL emulation)
    to make more consistent output.
  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation fixed to switch out of
    fullscreen mode IF DOSBox-X was fullscreen at the time the
    card is initialized.
  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation no longer allows fullscreen
    mode, and does everything it can to prevent window resizing.
  - Linux/X11 disable XRandR, XV, and X modeset functions. Do not
    change monitor resolution.
  - MPU-401 MIDI emulation fixed to look at all conductor message
    bytes for code 0xFC (ALL END) instead of just the first byte.
    This fixes hangs in games that send additional bytes prior to
    0xFC and then expect the MPU-401 to signal 0xFC back when the
    games are waiting for music to stop.
  - Fix DOS CON driver not to signal data ready for PC-98 scan
    codes that have no corresponding ANSI code. Tapping numeric
    keypad keys during the title screen in Touhou Project should
    no longer cause the game to pause waiting for keyboard input
    when going into demo mode.
  - Fix DOS CON driver to signal data ready for buffered escape
    code.
  - Fix PC-98 keyboard emulation not to apply IBM PC "extended"
    keyboard scancode filtering.
  - Window maximization does not count as a user resize preference.
  - Fix Windows builds to enable DirectSerial, Direct LPT, modem,
    emulation.
  - New mapper shortcut to restore the window's original size.
  - Fix bug with SHL instruction and OF flag, which corrects some
    games and their decompression routines.
  - Fullscreen (monitor) modesetting removed. DOSBox-X either runs
    in a window, or scales up to fill the monitor, but will not change
    the monitor resolution.
  - Resize handling fixed to differentiate user resize verses resize
    caused by DOSBox-X changing the window dimensions.
  - Linux/X11 fixes to avoid flickering when resizing the window, and
    to avoid redrawing unless necessary.
  - Window resize management, to scale/arrange the output to fit the
    window (for output= surface, opengl, direct3d)
  - Enable resizing again, except when the GUI or mapper is active.
  - Fix Linux/X11 to always take resize events, instead of ignoring
    all further resize events just because one resize event is forever
    "pending"
  - Linux/X11 builds now track the size of the window on the desktop,
    to keep track of resizing and maximizing.
0.82.2 (01/29/2018)
  - Linux builds no longer enable window resizing. The ability to
    resize will be added back when the emulator can better handle
    the user resizing the window.
  - Windows and Linux now have synchronized build date and version
    strings.
  - Codebase begin transition to C++11
  - The Windows maximize button no longer triggers fullscreen mode.
  - Direct3D, OpenGL, and Surface outputs updated to fill the window
    in Windows builds when the window is maximized. If aspect
    correction is enabled, the Direct3D and OpenGL outputs will
    scale the DOS screen (with pillarbox/letterbox padding) to the
    correct aspect ratio and center within the maximized window.
  - Fixed minor memory leak in MT32 (MUNT) synthesizer usage.
  - Fixed uninitialized state issues with DMA channel 4 (cascade).
  - IMGMOUNT now allows mounting the El Torito bootable floppy image
    of a CD-ROM drive as a drive letter and accessible (read only)
    filesystem. The FAT filesystem driver was fixed to support working
    from sources other than a direct file.
  - PC-98 mode fixed not to register certain built-in commands and
    binaries to drive Z:\ that are not compatible with PC-98 mode.
    MEM.EXE in particular uses IBM PC-specific techniques to gather
    it's information, and is therefore incompatible with PC-98 mode.
    This can be verified from the source code as MEM.EXE was evidently
    borrowed from the FreeDOS project.
  - EGA emulation (machine=ega) fixed to render 8bpp (256-color mode)
    instead of full 32bpp VGA output. EGA video output is limited to
    64-color (6-bit) by the design of the video connector (2-bit R/G/B)
    therefore the full precision of 32bpp is not needed. This will also
    benefit video capture as the reduced color bit depth will result
    in smaller AVI files when recording gameplay.
  - Added code to correctly detect 15-bit highcolor vs 16-bit highcolor
    display format support, despite SDL falsely indicating 16-bit
    color in both cases, which fixes incorrect colors on 15-bit display
    modes.
  - Fix up VGA DAC/palette mapping to display the emulator screen
    properly on 16-bit true color displays. Fixed off-by-one shift
    mistake in the DOSBox-X render scaler code that caused
    green and purple tints to colors on 16-bit true color displays.
  - Add "Show menu bar" command to the Windows "system menu" so that
    the menu bar can be brought back after selecting "hide menu bar".
  - Losing window focus while fullscreen no longer leaves the emulator
    window blank.
  - Maximize/restore fullscreen cleanup.
  - Removed DDRAW output.
  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to clear "success" flag at all failure
    return points. This fixes problems where unrecognizeable FAT
    filesystems are nonetheless presented as a drive letter with
    garbled filenames, when IMGMOUNT should have displayed an error
    instead.
  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to allow PC-98 HDI images to load that
    have headcount == 0 in the BPB.
  - Fix Adlib emulation not to register a mapper handler if emulation
    will jump to PC-98 mode, and fix mapper handler to check if Adlib
    emulation is loaded to avoid segfault.
  - Add "recording" volume to control the loudness of the audio going
    out to capture (WAV, AVI, etc.)
  - Separate mixer rendering from master volume. Apply master volume
    at the sound card only, leave audio at full volume for recording
    (WAV, AVI, etc. capture).
  - dosbox.conf and command line option to log CON driver output to
    a file. Anything written to STDOUT/CON by a DOS application is
    logged this way.
  - --time-limit <n> command line option to put a time limit on the
    emulator, in seconds.
  - Keyboard shortcut for the mapper UI no longer leaves keys "stuck"
    in the guest to cause problems when you exit the mapper UI.
  - Fixed code mistake that caused OpenGL NB output when dosbox.conf
    specified output=opengl
  - Mapper layout fixes:
    - Shortcut buttons (on the right hand side of the UI) fixed to
      become two columns wide if the button text won't fit in one
      column.
    - Some shortcut button titles shortened.
  - Mapper UI updated to show which bindings are being activated by
    hilighting buttons in the UI.
  - Mapper UI modifier buttons indicate status through hilighting.
  - Mapper UI joystick buttons and axes now use hilighting to indicate
    that there is input from the device.
  - Mapper fix for 4-axis joysticks that may count zero buttons, and
    then crash (divide by zero) when the user pushes a button on the
    joystick device.
  - BIOS emulation now allows you to specify binary blobs to execute
    in the guest system as part of startup. One can be specified to
    execute just after CPU reset/power-on, and the other just before
    booting to the DOS shell. THE BINARY BLOBS EXECUTE IN THE GUEST
    ENVIRONMENT AND NOT AS ARBITRARY CODE ON YOUR HOST. This option
    is provided for both automated testing and for the curious who
    may want to venture into low level ASM hacking.
  - INTRO.COM fixed to accept keyboard input correctly in both
    PC-98 and IBM PC mode. You can now browse the help text properly
    in either mode.
  - DOS shell fixed to accept DOSKEY-like input in both IBM PC and
    PC-98 mode (including arrow keys, F3, tab completion, etc.)
  - DOS CON emulation now provides function keys (F1-F10) in PC-98 mode.
  - DOS CON emulation fixed to process PC-98 BIOS codes and generate
    PC-98 ANSI escapes as real hardware normally does.
  - Mapper no longer shows two sets of the shortcuts (one overlaid
    over the keyboard), registration bug fixed.
  - PC-98 keyboard interrupt handler now handles CTRL key and
    passes most keys as-is down through INT 18h now.
  - Removed non-recursive page fault option. It is now always on,
    except for internal cases where it needs to be off for callback
    instructions to do their work properly.
  - Removed dynamic x86 core. It is old and unmaintained code that
    is incompatible with the non-recursive page fault system.
  - IRQ cascade interrupt fixes and cleanup.
  - BAT files given on the command line fixed to occur AFTER the
    registration of ULTRASND and BLASTER environment variables.
  - PC-98: DOS CON emulation fixed to decode Shift-JIS itself,
    with consideration that some proprietary double-byte encodings
    yield single-wide characters. DOS program using NEC's proprietary
    box/line drawing characters this way should display properly now.
  - DOSBox shell "greeting" now displays a proper box in PC-98 mode
    instead of framing the text in rows and columns of Katakana. (basic2004)

0.82.1 (12/25/2017)
  - Windows builds no longer redirect stdout and stderr to
    stdout.txt and stderr.txt. This also fixes problems
    with crashing or hanging when run from Program Files.
  - Windows releases compiled by TheGreatCodeholio again.
  - SDL 1.x and SDL 2.x support in the same branch, selectable
    by configuration option or VS2017 build target.
  - SC400 emulation fixes
  - Mac OS X pixel format fix to avoid corrupt graphics (Martin Lindhe)
  - MT32 emulation now explains what ROM images it's looking for,
    instead of just stating that it can't find the ROM images.
  - Direct3D shaders from Daum (alex)
  - NukeOPL OPL emulation
  - Basic (experimental) NEC PC-98 emulation (machine=pc98)
    - CG (character generator) emulation will need ANEX86.BMP
      or FREECG98.BMP
  - Some uninitialized state fixes
  - FDI, FDD floppy disk support (especially PC-98 games)
  - HDI hard disk support (especially PC-98 games)
  - DOS FAT filesystem driver: added many sanity, size,
    sector size and overrun checks.
  - Floppy and hard disk image support now supports sector
    sizes other than 512 bytes per sector (up to 1024).
  - DOS FAT filesystem driver can now handle FAT filesystems
    formatted with 256, 512, or 1024 bytes per sector.
  - INT 29h route output to CON driver in PC-98 mode so
    games can clear the screen with ANSI codes (Touhou Project).
  - NEC PC-98 support for proprietary ANSI codes to clear
    screen and show/hide function key row.
  - NEC PC-98 FM emulation (borrowed/ported from Project Neko II).
  - MPU-401 now emulates relative tempo change commands.
  - When mounting folders as a drive letter, filenames are
    now translated between guest and host according to the
    MS-DOS code page. This allows DOS games to use extended
    characters in a way that does not cause invalid filenames
    on the host. The host is always assumed to support unicode.
    Windows builds will use wide char (UTF-16) host names and
    Linux/Mac OS X builds will use UTF-8.
  - Code page translation for 437 (US MS-DOS) and 932 (PC-98 Shift-JIS).
  - Emulate DOS console function key row in PC-98 mode.

  - Aspect ratio menu item in Windows works correctly now
  - Capture menu works correctly now
  - Removed "overlay" output
  - Fix Direct3D and OpenGL output to enable linear interpolation (smoothing)
  - Fixed "double aspect ratio" issue with OpenGL output
  - Linux builds compiled against SDL 1.x and running against PulseAudio
    no longer hang/crash after some random amount of time (threading conflict)
  - PC-98 minimal mouse emulation
  - VGA doublescan=false fixed to display correctly, especially with scalers
  - SDL 1.x Windows builds fixed to process mouse motion FIRST before
    mouse buttons so that guest pointer integration with Windows 3.1
    works properly.
  - SDL 1.x Windows builds now enforce a 60Hz cap on mouse motion
    detection because recent versions of Windows have some latency
    when SDL repositions the mouse cursor. This fixes random
    erratic jumps in mouse motion when playing games that respond
    to mouse movement.
  - SDL 2.x fix touchscreen interaction on Windows
  - SDL 2.x mapper now responds to touchscreen as well as mouse.
  - DOSBox Integration device no longer enables it's ISA PnP device
    by default.
  - SDL 2.x fix Windows 3.1 "double-click" accidents by ignoring
    "mouse" events faked by Windows from the touchscreen.

  - SID frequency correction (basic2004)
  - Maximize button in Windows now consistently triggers fullscreen mode
  - SDL 2.x builds now use a different mapper file name to
    avoid conflicts with SDL 1.x builds. SDL scan codes are
    completely different between the two.
  - Windows builds now include WinPCAP support and NE2000 emulation.
  - MOUNT / IMGMOUNT convert backslash to forward slash in path on Linux to
    allow dosbox.conf files from Windows to work on Linux.
  - DOSBox-X officially no longer targets Windows XP.
    Unofficially third party builds may support Windows XP.
  - MPU-401 emulation now allows you to choose the IRQ, if desired.
  - Windows builds now include reference dosbox.conf so that you
    have a list of all options.
  - IMGMOUNT and FAT filesystem support now check partition type
    field to ensure that the partition chosen is a FAT filesystem.
  - IMGMOUNT no longer requires -size parameter if mounting
    a HDI disk image.
  - IMGMOUNT and FAT filesystem driver updated to support both
    IBM PC MBR (master boot record) and PC-98 IPL1 partition
    tables.
  - Fixed UMB memory selection not to overlap the EMS page frame.
  - EMS updated to sit at E000h in IBM PC mode and D000h in PC-98 mode.
  - Mapper interface now shows additional buttons for handlers
    registered after initial emulator setup phase.
  - Mapper fixed to load/save or apply default keybindings for
    handlers registered after initial emulator setup phase.
  - Mapper fixes now reveal "capture OPL", "hercules palette"
    options as well. The fixes also allow the default key
    bindings for those functions to work.
  - "CTTY NUL" no longer causes DOSBox-X to hang.
  - MOUNT now supports use of -q to suppress message when
    successfully unmounting a drive.
