(next)
  - BOOT now accepts a --debug switch that causes DOSBox-X to break into
    the debugger when the boot sector begins to execute.
  - BOOT now accepts a --force switch to override the PC-98 lockout,
    if the user wants to better understand why I locked it out in PC-98 mode.
  - PC-98 support now supports reading font from FONT.ROM, if available.
  - Code, data, and output now respond to arrow, page up/down and
    home/end keys as a user would normally expect.
  - Arrow and page up/down keyboard input now goes to active window
    instead of mapping directly to any specific window.
  - Debugger interface now has the concept of an "active" window, and
    the title bar of each window hilights if it is active.
  - Debugger interface now hides the "variables" window by default.
  - Fixed window "titles" in debugger interface to fill the terminal
    line they're on and use ncurses horizontal line character which
    on modern systems looks better than hyphens.
  - Removed one line padding around data window in debugger interface.
  - Debugger interface redesigned to permit more flexible layout
  - Debugger interface no longer crashes when terminal window is sized
    down too small (when there is no room for the output window)
  - EMM386 (ems) emulation fixed to always turn on the A20 gate when
    the DOS application requests to map pages into the EMS page frame.
    This fixes crashes with Creative's Sound Blaster 16 installer when
    run with the A20 gate turned off.
0.82.4 (02/28/2018)
  - Updated ramdisk formatting code to better match FAT12/FAT16
    specifications and limits (Shane32)
  - Menu items related to Gravis Ultrasound, Glide emulation, Innova SID,
    and other IBM PC-specific options are now grayed out in PC-98 mode.
  - Updated Windows menus to gray out CPU core and type options that
    are invalid. Selecting a prefetch CPU type while core dynamic is
    no longer possible, and selecting dynamic core while using a
    prefetch cpu type is no longer possible.
  - CPU type submenu in Windows updated to reflect all types supported
    by DOSBox-X including 8086 and 286 cores.
  - Fixed E_Exit() crash on Windows in PDCurses endwin() that only
    happens if you had never brought up the debugger console window.
  - Minor oddities with OPNA stereo panning resolved.
  - Sound Blaster, Adlib, and PC-98 FM emulation now reset state
    correctly when the reset signal is given to avoid stuck notes.
  - Fixed BIOS logo in PC-98 mode to properly reset the graphics mode
    so that the logo is visible.
  - Added Windows menu items to control PC-98 GDC speed, 4-partition enable,
    200-line "scanline" effect enable, and PIT timer clock control.
  - Added "Restart DOS" command to the Windows menu, with code to
    allow it only if at the initial DOS shell.
  - Added "multi-track WAV" command to the Windows menu, under Capture
  - Added "reset system" command to the Windows menu
  - "Restart" menu command updated to clarify that it restarts DOSBox-X entirely.
  - OpenGL HQ output removed.
  - Commands to force driver (DirectX or WINDIB) removed.
  - Default disk I/O limit raised to more reasonable speeds.
  - FM code borrowed from Neko Project II now compiles on Mac OS X
  - IMGMOUNT now supports mounting a RAM drive (using -t ram) (Shane32)
  - Direct3D fullscreen aspect ratio fixes, especially for
    monitors with a 5:4 aspect ratio (such as 1280x1024) (Shane32)
  - "Show menu" in Windows builds system menu is now a toggle
    to show/hide the menu bar (Shane32)
  - Fixed broken color palette with CGA composite and EGA
    machine emulation. Composite CGA and machine=ega displays
    properly again.
  - According to documentation, IBM PC and PC-98 use different
    initial PC speaker frequencies. Update the code to match.
  - 8254 I/O port alias at 3FD9h-3FDFh added, which is needed
    for several PC-98 games that program the PC speaker
    frequency through those ports instead of through 71h-77h
  - New Intel 8255 emulation. PC-98 system 8255 emulation
    now uses this emulation, along with PC speaker emulation.
  - Fixed XMS memory copy functions to enable the A20
    gate so extended memory copies work correctly whether
    or not the DOS application in question made the call
    with A20 enabled. This fixes crashes and memory
    corruption while installing Windows 3.1 using SETUP.EXE.
  - "CLS" now sends the proper ANSI escapes to clear the
    console in PC-98 mode.
  - BIOS logo in PC-98 fixed to clear graphics RAM and
    set graphics back to 8-color digital mode when booting
    to DOS. This should fix palette errors and color issues
    with older PC-98/PC-88 games that use the 8-color
    graphics modes.
  - Added PC-98 INT 1Ch timer interval BIOS function,
    and timer countdown routine in IRQ 0.
  - Windows builds now incorporate pdcurses and enable
    the debugger interface (bulletshot60)
  - DOSBox-X now tracks the systemwide keyboard layout
    on Windows, and acts on user changes to the keyboard
    and language in the system.
  - Removed hack code in SDL 1.x that sets DOSBox-X's
    keyboard layout to the US layout even if the host
    uses anything else.
  - Fix CPU cycles count increment not to nag you to use
    core=dynamic if a) dynamic core is not available or
    b) you're already using dynamic core.
  - Added dynamic core back, it seems to be very stable
    again.
  - PC-98 FM board now allows changing the base I/O port
    and IRQ (interrupt) line used by the card.
  - PC-98 mode now supports joystick emulation. Joystick
    input is mapped through the DOSBox mapper to the
    PC-98 FM board where DOS games expect to see it.
  - Added dosbox.conf option to select which PC-98 FM
    board to emulate.
  - Fixed PC-98 FM code to enable the ADPCM and Rhythm
    FM channels.
  - Re-ported Neko Project II FM board emulation, this
    time keeping the code intact and keeping the separate
    board emulations intact for PC-98 mode.
  - VGA palette errors with Crystal Dream II fixed.
  - PC-98 FM synthesis fixed not to initialize itself
    again when rebooting, which fixes a problem with
    garbled FM synthesis after rebooting.
  - Removed some now-unnecessary SDL Video quit/init
    calls from Windows builds.
  - machine=pc98 now starts entire emulation in PC-98
    mode instead of booting up in IBM PC mode and
    switching to PC-98 mode.
  - Initial "BIOS" startup screen now operates in
    PC-98 mode when machine=pc98.
  - Prefetch core debug code now disabled at compile
    time. Seems to be stable so far.
  - Prefetch core now emulates partial load of the
    prefetch buffer on miss, and completing the buffer
    fill on hit, to better emulate (probable) 80486
    behavior.
  - 486_prefetch is now a valid cputype setting, despite
    the setting having existed for years in the source
    code. Prior to this fix, 486_prefetch was ignored.
0.82.3 (02/13/2018)
  - Removed DOSBox SVN-style "fast" A20 gate emulation.
    Recent changes make it infeasible to keep. "fast" is
    now mapped to "mask" mode.
  - RAM aliasing is now always on, even if memalias is not
    set, in order to help enforce A20 gate behavior, and
    to fix emulator crashes when a non-aliased RAM page
    is referenced through an alias.
  - Cleanup and rewrite of prefetch core, to make the code
    cleaner and more readable and maintainable.
  - DOS file I/O updated to apply a proper delay rather
    than the old DOSBox SVN code's cycle count dependent
    method. The delay by default will slow disk I/O down
    to mid 1990's IDE PIO speeds, which can resolve issues
    with MS-DOS demoscene or game executables that can
    malfunction when disk I/O is too fast.
  - PIC code updated to enforce a proper IRQ delay on ALL
    IRQ signals, which fixes issues with MS-DOS executables
    that have race conditions between their code and their
    interrupt handlers.
  - DOS Shell now shows the full intro text only at first
    run, instead of every shell invocation.
  - Use FCB record size of 128 bytes if the FCB record size
    is zero (from DOSBox SVN).
  - PC speaker fix not to generate a continuous tone if
    the PIT timer was set to mode 0. This fixes issues with
    many early 1990s demoscene executables leaving the PC
    speaker enabled (BEEEEEEP).
  - Register DEBUGBOX.COM at DOS environment start instead
    of boot, which allows the command to work again.
  - EXE loader sets stack pointer (SS:SP) into PSP segment
    (from DOSBox SVN)
  - EXE loader fixed to use the larger of the minimum and
    maximum memory sizes listed in the EXE header, which
    fixes some demoscene executables with a minimum size
    larger than maximum.
  - VGA DAC (palette) emulation updated to better match
    actual SVGA chipset (Paradise SVGA) behavior, which
    fixes some VGA palette errors in some demoscene
    productions.
  - Added -nocachedir option to internal MOUNT command, to
    disable directory caching for a local folder mounted
    to a drive letter. When mounted this way, changes on
    the host filesystem are immediately visible in the
    guest DOS environment.
  - Added -ro and -rw options to internal MOUNT command, to
    allow mounting local folders to a drive letter as a
    read-only volume.
  - MIDI Fluidsynth fixed to initialize and free state properly
    so that switching to and from Fluidsynth doesn't cause
    a segfault or crash.
  - MPU-401 fixed to allow changes to MIDI configuration from
    CONFIG.COM.
  - DOS filename handling fixed to maintain ASCII conversion
    to uppercase, while not converting Shift-JIS double-byte
    characters in PC-98 mode. This fixes Shift-JIS filename
    corruption when the trailing byte can be mistaken for
    lowercase ASCII a to z.
  - Windows fixes to keep menu bar items updated with
    DOSBox-X state.
  - Remove WM_DROPFILES handling, for now. The code remains
    to allow re-enabling later.
  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to process only WM_COMMAND (menu
    bar) and WM_SYSCOMMAND (system menu) events so that
    the general chatter in modern Windows system does not
    drown out the messages. This fixes issues where the
    menu bar doesn't work on some systems.
  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to handle menu bar input using
    SDL's WM events instead of fighting with SDL's message
    pump to receive menu events. This fixes potential
    issues with losing menu bar events.
  - dosbox.conf reference included with Windows builds
    now uses MS-DOS line endings so that the file can be
    edited in NOTEPAD.EXE
  - New dosbox.conf option to control whether the menu is
    shown by default in Windows builds.
  - titlebar= SDL dosbox.conf option, to allow showing a more
    user friendly name for the program instead of just using
    the EXE name.
  - E_Exit() on Windows now displays the message using
    MessageBox() in addition to sending to STDERR, so that
    Windows users see the error even if they are running
    it from the desktop instead of the command line.
  - PC-98 EGC bit shifter emulation fixed to correctly support
    ascending and descending bit shifting in either direction.
    This fixes screen shake emulation errors with Touhou Project
    TH04 and TH05.
  - Linux/X11 fixes to SDL 1.x to better match and compare
    Visuals (descriptions of the screen) since X11 libraries
    don't seem to use the same pointer values for the same
    Visuals.
  - ALT+TAB or loss of focus from fullscreen in Windows now
    restores the window instead of minimizing it.
  - 3Dfx OpenGL will hide the minimize and maximize buttons
    in Windows while active.
  - Windows menu bar items are now grayed out when 3Dfx OpenGL
    emulation is active (items that cannot be used at that time).
  - Fix Windows system menu to always keep "show menu".
  - GFX rendering fixed not to render any output while 3Dfx
    OpenGL emulation is active.
  - 3Dfx OpenGL bug fixes to properly restore the DOS console
    when the 3Dfx card is de-initialized and the game returns
    to the DOS prompt.
  - Linux/X11 window output fixed to keep the window on the
    screen even when switching between OpenGL and non-OpenGL,
    and when setting the SDL video mode.
  - Remove some init hacks and SDL forced reinitialized hacks,
    so that the window is stable on the screen.
  - Added code to do more OpenGL state initialization (both
    output=opengl and when initializing 3Dfx OpenGL emulation)
    to make more consistent output.
  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation fixed to switch out of
    fullscreen mode IF DOSBox-X was fullscreen at the time the
    card is initialized.
  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation no longer allows fullscreen
    mode, and does everything it can to prevent window resizing.
  - Linux/X11 disable XRandR, XV, and X modeset functions. Do not
    change monitor resolution.
  - MPU-401 MIDI emulation fixed to look at all conductor message
    bytes for code 0xFC (ALL END) instead of just the first byte.
    This fixes hangs in games that send additional bytes prior to
    0xFC and then expect the MPU-401 to signal 0xFC back when the
    games are waiting for music to stop.
  - Fix DOS CON driver not to signal data ready for PC-98 scan
    codes that have no corresponding ANSI code. Tapping numeric
    keypad keys during the title screen in Touhou Project should
    no longer cause the game to pause waiting for keyboard input
    when going into demo mode.
  - Fix DOS CON driver to signal data ready for buffered escape
    code.
  - Fix PC-98 keyboard emulation not to apply IBM PC "extended"
    keyboard scancode filtering.
  - Window maximization does not count as a user resize preference.
  - Fix Windows builds to enable DirectSerial, Direct LPT, modem,
    emulation.
  - New mapper shortcut to restore the window's original size.
  - Fix bug with SHL instruction and OF flag, which corrects some
    games and their decompression routines.
  - Fullscreen (monitor) modesetting removed. DOSBox-X either runs
    in a window, or scales up to fill the monitor, but will not change
    the monitor resolution.
  - Resize handling fixed to differentiate user resize verses resize
    caused by DOSBox-X changing the window dimensions.
  - Linux/X11 fixes to avoid flickering when resizing the window, and
    to avoid redrawing unless necessary.
  - Window resize management, to scale/arrange the output to fit the
    window (for output= surface, opengl, direct3d)
  - Enable resizing again, except when the GUI or mapper is active.
  - Fix Linux/X11 to always take resize events, instead of ignoring
    all further resize events just because one resize event is forever
    "pending"
  - Linux/X11 builds now track the size of the window on the desktop,
    to keep track of resizing and maximizing.
0.82.2 (01/29/2018)
  - Linux builds no longer enable window resizing. The ability to
    resize will be added back when the emulator can better handle
    the user resizing the window.
  - Windows and Linux now have synchronized build date and version
    strings.
  - Codebase begin transition to C++11
  - The Windows maximize button no longer triggers fullscreen mode.
  - Direct3D, OpenGL, and Surface outputs updated to fill the window
    in Windows builds when the window is maximized. If aspect
    correction is enabled, the Direct3D and OpenGL outputs will
    scale the DOS screen (with pillarbox/letterbox padding) to the
    correct aspect ratio and center within the maximized window.
  - Fixed minor memory leak in MT32 (MUNT) synthesizer usage.
  - Fixed uninitialized state issues with DMA channel 4 (cascade).
  - IMGMOUNT now allows mounting the El Torito bootable floppy image
    of a CD-ROM drive as a drive letter and accessible (read only)
    filesystem. The FAT filesystem driver was fixed to support working
    from sources other than a direct file.
  - PC-98 mode fixed not to register certain built-in commands and
    binaries to drive Z:\ that are not compatible with PC-98 mode.
    MEM.EXE in particular uses IBM PC-specific techniques to gather
    it's information, and is therefore incompatible with PC-98 mode.
    This can be verified from the source code as MEM.EXE was evidently
    borrowed from the FreeDOS project.
  - EGA emulation (machine=ega) fixed to render 8bpp (256-color mode)
    instead of full 32bpp VGA output. EGA video output is limited to
    64-color (6-bit) by the design of the video connector (2-bit R/G/B)
    therefore the full precision of 32bpp is not needed. This will also
    benefit video capture as the reduced color bit depth will result
    in smaller AVI files when recording gameplay.
  - Added code to correctly detect 15-bit highcolor vs 16-bit highcolor
    display format support, despite SDL falsely indicating 16-bit
    color in both cases, which fixes incorrect colors on 15-bit display
    modes.
  - Fix up VGA DAC/palette mapping to display the emulator screen
    properly on 16-bit true color displays. Fixed off-by-one shift
    mistake in the DOSBox-X render scaler code that caused
    green and purple tints to colors on 16-bit true color displays.
  - Add "Show menu bar" command to the Windows "system menu" so that
    the menu bar can be brought back after selecting "hide menu bar".
  - Losing window focus while fullscreen no longer leaves the emulator
    window blank.
  - Maximize/restore fullscreen cleanup.
  - Removed DDRAW output.
  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to clear "success" flag at all failure
    return points. This fixes problems where unrecognizeable FAT
    filesystems are nonetheless presented as a drive letter with
    garbled filenames, when IMGMOUNT should have displayed an error
    instead.
  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to allow PC-98 HDI images to load that
    have headcount == 0 in the BPB.
  - Fix Adlib emulation not to register a mapper handler if emulation
    will jump to PC-98 mode, and fix mapper handler to check if Adlib
    emulation is loaded to avoid segfault.
  - Add "recording" volume to control the loudness of the audio going
    out to capture (WAV, AVI, etc.)
  - Separate mixer rendering from master volume. Apply master volume
    at the sound card only, leave audio at full volume for recording
    (WAV, AVI, etc. capture).
  - dosbox.conf and command line option to log CON driver output to
    a file. Anything written to STDOUT/CON by a DOS application is
    logged this way.
  - --time-limit <n> command line option to put a time limit on the
    emulator, in seconds.
  - Keyboard shortcut for the mapper UI no longer leaves keys "stuck"
    in the guest to cause problems when you exit the mapper UI.
  - Fixed code mistake that caused OpenGL NB output when dosbox.conf
    specified output=opengl
  - Mapper layout fixes:
    - Shortcut buttons (on the right hand side of the UI) fixed to
      become two columns wide if the button text won't fit in one
      column.
    - Some shortcut button titles shortened.
  - Mapper UI updated to show which bindings are being activated by
    hilighting buttons in the UI.
  - Mapper UI modifier buttons indicate status through hilighting.
  - Mapper UI joystick buttons and axes now use hilighting to indicate
    that there is input from the device.
  - Mapper fix for 4-axis joysticks that may count zero buttons, and
    then crash (divide by zero) when the user pushes a button on the
    joystick device.
  - BIOS emulation now allows you to specify binary blobs to execute
    in the guest system as part of startup. One can be specified to
    execute just after CPU reset/power-on, and the other just before
    booting to the DOS shell. THE BINARY BLOBS EXECUTE IN THE GUEST
    ENVIRONMENT AND NOT AS ARBITRARY CODE ON YOUR HOST. This option
    is provided for both automated testing and for the curious who
    may want to venture into low level ASM hacking.
  - INTRO.COM fixed to accept keyboard input correctly in both
    PC-98 and IBM PC mode. You can now browse the help text properly
    in either mode.
  - DOS shell fixed to accept DOSKEY-like input in both IBM PC and
    PC-98 mode (including arrow keys, F3, tab completion, etc.)
  - DOS CON emulation now provides function keys (F1-F10) in PC-98 mode.
  - DOS CON emulation fixed to process PC-98 BIOS codes and generate
    PC-98 ANSI escapes as real hardware normally does.
  - Mapper no longer shows two sets of the shortcuts (one overlaid
    over the keyboard), registration bug fixed.
  - PC-98 keyboard interrupt handler now handles CTRL key and
    passes most keys as-is down through INT 18h now.
  - Removed non-recursive page fault option. It is now always on,
    except for internal cases where it needs to be off for callback
    instructions to do their work properly.
  - Removed dynamic x86 core. It is old and unmaintained code that
    is incompatible with the non-recursive page fault system.
  - IRQ cascade interrupt fixes and cleanup.
  - BAT files given on the command line fixed to occur AFTER the
    registration of ULTRASND and BLASTER environment variables.
  - PC-98: DOS CON emulation fixed to decode Shift-JIS itself,
    with consideration that some proprietary double-byte encodings
    yield single-wide characters. DOS program using NEC's proprietary
    box/line drawing characters this way should display properly now.
  - DOSBox shell "greeting" now displays a proper box in PC-98 mode
    instead of framing the text in rows and columns of Katakana. (basic2004)

0.82.1 (12/25/2017)
  - Windows builds no longer redirect stdout and stderr to
    stdout.txt and stderr.txt. This also fixes problems
    with crashing or hanging when run from Program Files.
  - Windows releases compiled by TheGreatCodeholio again.
  - SDL 1.x and SDL 2.x support in the same branch, selectable
    by configuration option or VS2017 build target.
  - SC400 emulation fixes
  - Mac OS X pixel format fix to avoid corrupt graphics (Martin Lindhe)
  - MT32 emulation now explains what ROM images it's looking for,
    instead of just stating that it can't find the ROM images.
  - Direct3D shaders from Daum (alex)
  - NukeOPL OPL emulation
  - Basic (experimental) NEC PC-98 emulation (machine=pc98)
    - CG (character generator) emulation will need ANEX86.BMP
      or FREECG98.BMP
  - Some uninitialized state fixes
  - FDI, FDD floppy disk support (especially PC-98 games)
  - HDI hard disk support (especially PC-98 games)
  - DOS FAT filesystem driver: added many sanity, size,
    sector size and overrun checks.
  - Floppy and hard disk image support now supports sector
    sizes other than 512 bytes per sector (up to 1024).
  - DOS FAT filesystem driver can now handle FAT filesystems
    formatted with 256, 512, or 1024 bytes per sector.
  - INT 29h route output to CON driver in PC-98 mode so
    games can clear the screen with ANSI codes (Touhou Project).
  - NEC PC-98 support for proprietary ANSI codes to clear
    screen and show/hide function key row.
  - NEC PC-98 FM emulation (borrowed/ported from Project Neko II).
  - MPU-401 now emulates relative tempo change commands.
  - When mounting folders as a drive letter, filenames are
    now translated between guest and host according to the
    MS-DOS code page. This allows DOS games to use extended
    characters in a way that does not cause invalid filenames
    on the host. The host is always assumed to support unicode.
    Windows builds will use wide char (UTF-16) host names and
    Linux/Mac OS X builds will use UTF-8.
  - Code page translation for 437 (US MS-DOS) and 932 (PC-98 Shift-JIS).
  - Emulate DOS console function key row in PC-98 mode.
  - PC-98 EGC graphics emulation (minimal)
  - PC-98 CG support for custom fonts (RAM portion)
  - PC-98 EGC minimal ROP emulation
  - PC-98 select between 2.5MHZ and 5MHz GDC (for games that demand one or the other)
  - Aspect ratio menu item in Windows works correctly now
  - Capture menu works correctly now
  - Removed "overlay" output
  - Fix Direct3D and OpenGL output to enable linear interpolation (smoothing)
  - Fixed "double aspect ratio" issue with OpenGL output
  - Linux builds compiled against SDL 1.x and running against PulseAudio
    no longer hang/crash after some random amount of time (threading conflict)
  - PC-98 minimal mouse emulation
  - VGA doublescan=false fixed to display correctly, especially with scalers
  - SDL 1.x Windows builds fixed to process mouse motion FIRST before
    mouse buttons so that guest pointer integration with Windows 3.1
    works properly.
  - SDL 1.x Windows builds now enforce a 60Hz cap on mouse motion
    detection because recent versions of Windows have some latency
    when SDL repositions the mouse cursor. This fixes random
    erratic jumps in mouse motion when playing games that respond
    to mouse movement.
  - SDL 2.x fix touchscreen interaction on Windows
  - SDL 2.x mapper now responds to touchscreen as well as mouse.
  - DOSBox Integration device no longer enables it's ISA PnP device
    by default.
  - SDL 2.x fix Windows 3.1 "double-click" accidents by ignoring
    "mouse" events faked by Windows from the touchscreen.
  - "Paper white" HGC/CGA monochrome palette (basic2004)
  - CMS (GameBlaster) frequency correction (basic2004)
  - SID frequency correction (basic2004)
  - Maximize button in Windows now consistently triggers fullscreen mode
  - SDL 2.x builds now use a different mapper file name to
    avoid conflicts with SDL 1.x builds. SDL scan codes are
    completely different between the two.
  - Windows builds now include WinPCAP support and NE2000 emulation.
  - MOUNT / IMGMOUNT convert backslash to forward slash in path on Linux to
    allow dosbox.conf files from Windows to work on Linux.
  - DOSBox-X officially no longer targets Windows XP.
    Unofficially third party builds may support Windows XP.
  - MPU-401 emulation now allows you to choose the IRQ, if desired.
  - Windows builds now include reference dosbox.conf so that you
    have a list of all options.
  - IMGMOUNT and FAT filesystem support now check partition type
    field to ensure that the partition chosen is a FAT filesystem.
  - IMGMOUNT no longer requires -size parameter if mounting
    a HDI disk image.
  - IMGMOUNT and FAT filesystem driver updated to support both
    IBM PC MBR (master boot record) and PC-98 IPL1 partition
    tables.
  - Fixed UMB memory selection not to overlap the EMS page frame.
  - EMS updated to sit at E000h in IBM PC mode and D000h in PC-98 mode.
  - Mapper interface now shows additional buttons for handlers
    registered after initial emulator setup phase.
  - Mapper fixed to load/save or apply default keybindings for
