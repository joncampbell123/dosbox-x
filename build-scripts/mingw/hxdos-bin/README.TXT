README for DOSBox-X DOS version
===============================

Welcome to DOSBox-X, a cross-platform DOS emulator based on the DOSBox project.

This is the special DOS version of DOSBox-X for use in a real DOS system. Not all features supported in other platforms can be supported in this version.

Simply run DOSBOX-X.EXE in MS-DOS 5.0+ or compatible (such as FreeDOS) to start DOSBox-X, as all required HX DOS Extender files are already included in the package.

It is recommended to run DOSBox-X on a DOS system with at least 128MB of RAM. You can start DOSBox-X on a DOS system with 96MB of RAM with command "DOSBOX-X -SET MEMSIZE=4".

If you want to enable long filename support, before running DOSBox-X you also need to load the (freely available) DOSLFN driver and then start DOSBox-X with "DOSBOX-X -SET LFN=1".

If network functionality (such as IPX and Modem support) is desired, you will need to load a packet driver for your ethernet card, and modify the settings in WATTCP.CFG where needed.

For running DOSBox-X with a language file rather than English (default), you can use -LANGCP option to specify a language file, such as "DOSBOX-X -LANGCP JA_JP" for Japanese messages.
