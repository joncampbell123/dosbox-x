SDL on BeOS R5
==============

You can build SDL on BeOS like any other GNU style package.
e.g. ./configure && make && make install
By default it is installed in /boot/develop/tools/gnupro/{bin,lib,etc.}

Once you install SDL, you need to copy libSDL.so to /boot/home/config/lib,
so it can be found by the dynamic linker.

Enjoy!
