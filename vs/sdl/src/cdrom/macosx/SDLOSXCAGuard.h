    This is your typical mutex with signalling implemented via pthreads.
    Lock() will return true if and only if the guard is locked on that call.
    A thread that already has the guard will receive 'false' if it locks it
    again. Use of the stack-based CAGuard::Locker class is highly recommended
    to properly manage the recursive nesting. The Wait calls with timeouts
    will return true if and only if the timeout period expired. They will
    return false if they receive notification any other way.
