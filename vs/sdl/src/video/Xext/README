The reason these libraries are built outside of the standard XFree86
tree is so that they can be linked as shared object code directly into
SDL without causing any symbol collisions with code in the application.

You can't link static library code into shared libraries on non-x86
Linux platforms.  Since these libraries haven't become standard yet,
we'll just include them directly.

These sources are synchronized with XFree86 4.2.1
