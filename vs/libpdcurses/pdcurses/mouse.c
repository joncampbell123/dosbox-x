### Description

   As of PDCurses 3.0, there are two separate mouse interfaces: the
   classic interface, which is based on the undocumented Sys V
   mouse functions; and an ncurses-compatible interface. Both are
   active at all times, and you can mix and match functions from
   each, though it's not recommended. The ncurses interface is
   essentially an emulation layer built on top of the classic
   interface; it's here to allow easier porting of ncurses apps.

   The classic interface: mouse_set(), mouse_on(), mouse_off(),
   request_mouse_pos(), map_button(), wmouse_position(),
   getmouse(), and getbmap(). An application using this interface
   would start by calling mouse_set() or mouse_on() with a non-zero
   value, often ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS. Then it would check for a
   KEY_MOUSE return from getch(). If found, it would call
   request_mouse_pos() to get the current mouse status.

   mouse_set(), mouse_on() and mouse_off() are analagous to
   attrset(), attron() and attroff().  These functions set the
   mouse button events to trap.  The button masks used in these
   functions are defined in curses.h and can be or'ed together.
   They are the group of masks starting with BUTTON1_RELEASED.

   request_mouse_pos() requests curses to fill in the Mouse_status
   structure with the current state of the mouse.

   map_button() enables the specified mouse action to activate the
   Soft Label Keys if the action occurs over the area of the screen
   where the Soft Label Keys are displayed.  The mouse actions are
   defined in curses.h in the group that starts with BUTTON_RELEASED.

   wmouse_position() determines if the current mouse position is
   within the window passed as an argument.  If the mouse is
   outside the current window, -1 is returned in the y and x
   arguments; otherwise the y and x coordinates of the mouse
   (relative to the top left corner of the window) are returned in
   y and x.

   getmouse() returns the current status of the trapped mouse
   buttons as set by mouse_set() or mouse_on().

   getbmap() returns the current status of the button action used
   to map a mouse action to the Soft Label Keys as set by the
   map_button() function.

   The ncurses interface: mouseinterval(), wenclose(),
   wmouse_trafo(), mouse_trafo(), mousemask(), nc_getmouse(), and
   ungetmouse(). A typical application using this interface would
   start by calling mousemask() with a non-zero value, often
   ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS. Then it would check for a KEY_MOUSE return
   from getch(). If found, it would call nc_getmouse() to get the
   current mouse status.

   mouseinterval() sets the timeout for a mouse click. On all
   current platforms, PDCurses receives mouse button press and
   release events, but must synthesize click events. It does this
   by checking whether a release event is queued up after a press
   event. If it gets a press event, and there are no more events
   waiting, it will wait for the timeout interval, then check again
   for a release. A press followed by a release is reported as
   BUTTON_CLICKED; otherwise it's passed through as BUTTON_PRESSED.
   The default timeout is 150ms; valid values are 0 (no clicks
   reported) through 1000ms. In x11, the timeout can also be set
   via the clickPeriod resource. The return value from
   mouseinterval() is the old timeout. To check the old value
   without setting a new one, call it with a parameter of -1. Note
   that although there's no classic equivalent for this function
   (apart from the clickPeriod resource), the value set applies in
   both interfaces.

   wenclose() reports whether the given screen-relative y, x
   coordinates fall within the given window.

   wmouse_trafo() converts between screen-relative and window-
   relative coordinates. A to_screen parameter of TRUE means to
   convert from window to screen; otherwise the reverse. The
   function returns FALSE if the coordinates aren't within the
   window, or if any of the parameters are NULL. The coordinates
   have been converted when the function returns TRUE.

   mouse_trafo() is the stdscr version of wmouse_trafo().

   mousemask() is nearly equivalent to mouse_set(), but instead of
   OK/ERR, it returns the value of the mask after setting it. (This
   isn't necessarily the same value passed in, since the mask could
   be altered on some platforms.) And if the second parameter is a
   non-null pointer, mousemask() stores the previous mask value
   there. Also, since the ncurses interface doesn't work with
   PDCurses' BUTTON_MOVED events, mousemask() filters them out.

   nc_getmouse() returns the current mouse status in an MEVENT
   struct. This is equivalent to ncurses' getmouse(), renamed to
   avoid conflict with PDCurses' getmouse(). But if you define
   NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION (preferably as 2) before including
   curses.h, it defines getmouse() to nc_getmouse(), along with a
   few other redefintions needed for compatibility with ncurses
   code. nc_getmouse() calls request_mouse_pos(), which (not
   getmouse()) is the classic equivalent.

   ungetmouse() is the mouse equivalent of ungetch(). However,
   PDCurses doesn't maintain a queue of mouse events; only one can
   be pushed back, and it can overwrite or be overwritten by real
   mouse events.
